"""INV-038 — IDLE-TIMER-RESET-ON-INPUT.

ROM tracks player idleness with ``ch->timer``: ``char_update``
(src/update.c:717-753) increments it once per game tick for every
non-immortal PC *regardless of whether a descriptor is attached*, voids the
character to limbo at ``++ch->timer >= 12``, and the autosave/autoquit second
loop quits the character once ``ch->timer > 30`` (src/update.c:682-683 sets
``ch_quit``). The timer is reset to 0 **only when the descriptor delivers
input** (src/comm.c:605, before ``interpret``), on reconnect (src/comm.c:1856),
and on return-from-void (src/comm.c:1918).

The Python port previously reset ``timer = 0`` on every ``char_update`` tick
whenever a descriptor was present (mud/game_loop.py), so a connected player
*never* accumulated idle time: the idle→void (≥12) and idle→autoquit (>30)
mechanics were dead for anyone logged in, and there was no reset-on-input path
anywhere in ``mud/``. This is a cross-file contract: ``char_update`` must let
the timer climb for connected players, and the command-input chokepoint must be
the thing that resets it.

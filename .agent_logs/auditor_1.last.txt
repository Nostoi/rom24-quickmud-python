Made a small, idempotent plan cleanup and validation pass.

What I changed
- Rebuilt “Next Actions (Aggregated P0s)” to reflect zero open [P0] tasks.

Why
- All subsystem blocks list [P0] items as completed; the dashboard still showed two stale [P0]s.

Validation
- ruff check: failed with repository lint errors (unrelated to this audit). Did not proceed to mypy/pytest since ruff already fails; no parity code changes were made.

Diff summary
- Files touched: 1 (within cap 5)
- Lines changed: 2 (within cap 300)

No new rules were added.

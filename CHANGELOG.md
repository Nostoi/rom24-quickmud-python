# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.14.24] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **MOBCMD-019 — `mob remember <unresolved>` left a stale mprog_target** — ROM
  `do_mpremember` (`src/mob_cmds.c:1155-1164`) assigns
  `ch->mprog_target = get_char_world(ch, arg)` *unconditionally* for a non-empty
  argument, so a lookup that finds no one returns `NULL` and **clears** the
  remembered target. The Python port early-returned on a failed lookup, leaving
  the previous target in place — `$q`/`$Q` mobprog substitution codes would then
  resolve to a departed character. `do_mpremember` now assigns the lookup result
  unconditionally for non-empty args (the empty-arg `bug()` branch still leaves
  the target untouched). Test:
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_remember.py::test_remember_unknown_name_clears_stale_target`.

## [2.14.23] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Two xdist test flakes (test-isolation hardening, no production change)** —
  - `test_hpcnt_fires_exactly_once_per_violence_tick` —
    `violence_tick` walks the **global** `character_registry`
    (`mud/game_loop.py:1590`), so a fighting NPC leaked by a sibling test on the
    same xdist worker fired its own HPCNT and inflated the call count. The test
    now snapshots and replaces the registry contents in place
    (`character_registry[:] = [attacker, victim]`) so the pulse sees only its two
    actors, restoring on teardown.
  - `test_ac_clamping_for_negative_values` — ROM's to-hit roll is
    `number_bits(5)` (`src/fight.c:508`), **not** `number_percent`, and a natural
    `diceroll == 0` is an automatic miss regardless of hitroll/AC
    (`src/fight.c:510`). The test pinned `number_percent` (no effect on the d20
    roll), so leaked global RNG landed on 0 ~1/20 runs and flaked the
    `"miss" not in result` assertion under `-n auto`. Now pins `number_bits` to
    19 (the auto-hit roll) for a deterministic hit.

## [2.14.22] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **WIZ-051 — `find_location` missing object fallback** — ROM `find_location`
  (`src/act_wiz.c:780-795`) resolves a target in three steps: numeric vnum →
  `get_char_world` (→ `victim->in_room`) → `get_obj_world` (→ `obj->in_room`).
  The Python port stopped after the character lookup, so `at <object>`,
  `goto <object>`, and `transfer <player> <object>` could not target the room an
  object lies in (they answered "No such location."). Added the object fallback
  returning `obj.in_room`. Test:
  `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py::test_goto_object_resolves_to_room_object_lies_in`.

## [2.14.21] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **INV-046 family 3b — phantom stat-table aliases printed zero/empty in production** — a second
  wave of immortal/info commands read attributes `mud/registry.py` never defines, via
  `getattr(registry, "<name>", default)`, silently scanning the empty default on a live system.
  Each reader is rewired to its real backing structure:
  - `slookup` `skill_table` → `mud.skills.registry.skill_registry.skills` (name-keyed; ROM `sn`
    preserved by enumerate); `slookup all` now lists the 134 loaded skills (`src/act_wiz.c:3191`).
  - `owhere` `object_list` → `mud.models.obj.object_registry` (`src/act_wiz.c:1886`).
  - `memory`/`dump` `areas`/`rooms`/`helps`/`socials` → `registry.area_registry` /
    `registry.room_registry` / `mud.models.help.help_entries` / `mud.models.social.social_registry`
    (counts were all 0; `src/db.c:3289`). The `dump` `areas`/`rooms` reads were missed by the
    family-3a sweep and caught here.
  - `count`/`whois` `player_registry` fallback → `character_registry` PC filter; `max_on_today`
    promoted to a real `mud/registry.py` scalar mirroring ROM's static `max_on`
    (`src/act_info.c:2228`).
  - `unread` `note_boards` + `pcdata.last_read` → `mud.notes.board_registry` + `pcdata.last_notes`.
  - `sset` and `peek`'s skill lookup `skill_table` + `pcdata.learned[sn]` → the canonical
    name-keyed `char.skills` store (the old writes/reads hit a dict the game never consults, so
    `sset` silently no-op'd and `peek` always resolved to 0). A dead duplicate
    `remaining_rom._get_skill` (no callers) was removed.
  - `socials` `social_table` → `mud.models.social.social_registry` (answered "No socials found."
    despite 244 loaded; `src/act_info.c:606`).
  - `groups all` / `groups <name>` `group_table` → `mud.skills.groups` (`list_groups`/`get_group`);
    also fixed the `.spells` field name to the real `GroupType.skills`, so groups list their
    member skills instead of "(none)".
  - Layer-A guard (`tests/test_phantom_registry_convention.py`) extended to ban all 13 phantom
    alias names; `max_on_today` and the five real `*_registry` dicts are deliberately allowed.
  Tests: `tests/integration/test_inv046_family3b.py` (11). **INV-046 is now fully closed and
  flipped to ✅ ENFORCED.** (INV-046 family 3b)

## [2.14.20] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **INV-046 family 3a — `do_mfind`/`do_ofind` crashed in production** — both commands read
  `registry.mob_prototypes` / `registry.obj_prototypes` directly, which do not exist on
  `mud/registry.py` (real names: `mob_registry` / `obj_registry`), raising `AttributeError` for
  every immortal `mfind`/`ofind` call. Additionally the match logic used substring search on a
  nonexistent `name` field; corrected to ROM `is_name()` whole-word prefix match on
  `player_name`/`name` (`src/act_wiz.c:1100-1140, 1180-1220`). `do_memory` (`imm_search.py`) and
  `do_dump` (`imm_server.py`) also used `getattr(registry, "mob_prototypes/obj_prototypes", {})`,
  printing 0 prototype counts in production despite ~986 loaded mobs and ~1200 loaded objects;
  corrected to `registry.mob_registry` / `registry.obj_registry` (`src/db.c:3307,3340,3355`).
  Tests 13–15 in `tests/integration/test_inv046_phantom_registry.py`. (INV-046 family 3a)

## [2.14.19] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **INV-046 Layer-A grep-guard** — new `tests/test_phantom_registry_convention.py` forbids the
  phantom `registry.char_list`/`registry.players` attribute pattern on BOTH sides of the feedback
  loop that produced the bug class: no reads under `mud/` (production walks must use
  `character_registry`/`registry.descriptor_list`) and no injections under `tests/` (a test that
  fabricates the phantom attributes lets new code "pass" against a structure the live game never
  populates). Same scanner shape as `test_equipment_key_convention.py`.

### Changed

- Cleaned all ~60 phantom `registry.char_list`/`registry.players` injection sites out of 10 test
  files (`test_act_wiz_command_parity.py`, the four `test_inv025_*_dispatch.py` files,
  `test_inv025_command_broadcast_pers_sweep.py`, `test_flag_command_parity.py`,
  `test_inv029_act_first_letter_cap.py`, `test_order_broadcasts.py`, `test_purge_broadcasts.py`) —
  the fixtures and helpers now populate only the real `character_registry` (and the legitimate
  lazily-attached `registry.descriptor_list`). No behavior change; the full suite stays green,
  proving the injections were dead weight after the 2.14.18 walk rewrites.

## [2.14.18] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **INV-046 family 2 — every remaining phantom `registry.char_list`/`registry.players` walk
  rewritten against the real structures** — `transfer all` now walks `descriptor_list`
  (`src/act_wiz.c:816-831`, preserving the optional location argument), `force players`/`force
  gods` walk `character_registry` newest-first (`:4233-4278`, INV-045 order), `force all` now
  accepts the port's `CON_PLAYING=1` (the old `!= 0` check skipped every live connection),
  reboot/shutdown announce through the real `do_echo` descriptor walk and save via
  `descriptor_list` (`:2027-2084`), `mwhere` walks descriptors (no-arg, with can_see/can_see_room
  and switched-body display) and `character_registry` with whole-word `is_name` (named branch,
  `:1950-2015`), `do_memory`/`do_dump` counts derive from `character_registry`
  (`src/db.c:3307,3358-3367`), `gecho` delegates to `do_echo` (`src/interp.c:331`), restore-all's
  dead phantom fallback is deleted, and `player_config._die_follower` delegates to the canonical
  `mud.characters.follow.die_follower` (`src/act_comm.c:1658-1680` — cross-room followers now
  released). Filed **INV-046 family 3**: phantom stat-table aliases remain
  (`registry.mob_prototypes`/`obj_prototypes` direct reads crash `mfind`/`ofind` in production;
  ~14 more getattr-with-default sites print zero/empty). Tests (9 new, production-shape):
  `tests/integration/test_inv046_phantom_registry.py`.

## [2.14.17] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **INV-046 family 1 — `imm_commands.py` shipped a divergent duplicate
  `get_char_world`/`get_char_room` pair scanning phantom registry attributes** —
  the duplicates read `getattr(registry, "char_list", [])` / `getattr(registry, "players", {})`,
  attributes that do not exist on `mud/registry.py` in production (only tests injected them),
  so every production immortal world-by-name lookup (notell/freeze/transfer/force/… — 25
  direct callers across 8 importer modules) silently resolved nothing and answered "They
  aren't here." for live targets. ROM has exactly ONE lookup pair (`src/handler.c:2194-2243`,
  can_see + whole-word-prefix `is_name` gated, "self" keyword, roomless-skip); the module now
  re-exports the canonical `mud.world.char_find` implementations. Filed **WIZ-051** (🔄 OPEN):
  `find_location` is still missing ROM's `get_obj_world` fallback (`src/act_wiz.c:780-795`).
  Test: `tests/integration/test_inv046_phantom_registry.py`.

## [2.14.16] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **HANDLER-006 — `get_char_world` returned the OLDEST name match; ROM returns the NEWEST** —
  INV-045 (CHAR-LIST-WALK-ORDER) consequence class (b): ROM's world scan
  (`src/handler.c:2234-2240`) walks the head-inserted `char_list`, so the first `is_name`
  match is the most recently created char and `2.name` counts newest→oldest; the port's
  forward `character_registry` scan inverted both whenever ≥2 same-named chars were live
  (`tell guard`, `cast ... guard`, every `get_char_world` caller). Now iterates reversed.
  Python: `mud/world/char_find.py:get_char_world`.
  Test: `tests/integration/test_handler006_get_char_world_newest_match.py`.

## [2.14.15] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **GL-043 — `aggressive_update` iterated `character_registry` oldest-first; ROM walks
  `char_list` newest-first** — last RNG-bearing site of INV-045 (CHAR-LIST-WALK-ORDER). ROM
  `aggr_update` (`src/update.c:1087-1092`) walks the head-inserted `char_list` for the PC
  watcher, so the `number_bits(1)` aggression coin and `number_range(0, count)` victim
  reservoir rolls are drawn newest-watcher-first; the port drew them oldest-first, desyncing
  the shared Mitchell-Moore stream whenever ≥2 PCs were live. Now walks reversed with the
  extracted-skip guard (a watcher killed mid-tick is never revisited), mirroring the
  GL-040/041/042 pattern. Python: `mud/ai/aggressive.py:aggressive_update`.
  Test: `tests/integration/test_mob_ai.py::TestAggressiveUpdateIterationOrder`.

## [2.14.14] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **LOOK-006 — `do_look` dark gate missing the PLR_HOLYLIGHT conjunct** — ROM's pitch-black
  gate (`src/act_info.c:1068-1069`) is `!IS_NPC && !IS_SET(act, PLR_HOLYLIGHT) && room_is_dark`;
  the port gated only on `!IS_NPC && room_is_dark` (a stale `TODO: Add PLR_HOLYLIGHT check`
  comment sat where the conjunct belonged, even though `PlayerFlag.HOLYLIGHT` has existed in
  constants all along), so holylight immortals in dark rooms wrongly got "It is pitch black ...".
  The audit doc had marked the dark gate ✅ FIXED while quoting the very ROM line containing the
  missing flag (stale-✅ class). Python: `mud/world/look.py` (`look`).
  Test: `tests/integration/test_look_holylight_rom_parity.py::TestDarkGateHolylight`.

## [2.14.13] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **LOOK-005 — `check_blind` missing the PLR_HOLYLIGHT bypass** — ROM `check_blind`
  (`src/act_info.c:544-545`) returns TRUE for a non-NPC with PLR_HOLYLIGHT *before* testing
  AFF_BLIND, so blind holylight immortals still see; the Python port only tested AFF_BLIND.
  `do_exits` additionally tested AFF_BLIND raw instead of calling `check_blind` (ROM
  `src/act_info.c:1404`), missing the same bypass. The audit row had claimed "100% PARITY" at
  `mud/rom_api.py:check_blind` — a module that no longer exists (stale-✅ class). Python:
  `mud/world/vision.py:check_blind`, `mud/commands/inspection.py:do_exits`.
  Test: `tests/integration/test_look_holylight_rom_parity.py::TestCheckBlindHolylight`.

## [2.14.12] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **GL-042 — `mobile_update` iterated `character_registry` oldest-first; ROM walks `char_list`
  newest-first** — third site of INV-045 (CHAR-LIST-WALK-ORDER). The shop-wealth replenishment
  `number_range(1,20)` pairs, scavenger 1/64 roll, and wander door rolls consumed the shared
  Mitchell-Moore stream in reversed mob order vs C whenever ≥2 NPCs were live. Fixed by iterating
  `list(reversed(character_registry))` with a mid-tick extraction skip, mirroring GL-040/GL-041.
  ROM C: `src/update.c:416` + `src/db.c:2256-2257`. Python: `mud/ai/__init__.py:mobile_update`.
  Test: `tests/integration/test_mob_ai.py::TestMobileUpdateIterationOrder`.

## [2.14.11] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **GL-041 — `char_update` main walk iterated `character_registry` oldest-first; ROM walks
  `char_list` newest-first** — ROM head-inserts every new character (`src/db.c:2256-2257`,
  `src/nanny.c:757-758`), so `char_update` (`src/update.c:661-786`) visits the newest character
  first. Python's forward walk reversed the shared Mitchell-Moore RNG draw order (wander-home
  `number_percent`, per-affect `number_range(0,4)` fade rolls, plague/poison damage rolls)
  whenever ≥2 characters were live. Fixed by iterating `list(reversed(character_registry))` with
  a mid-tick extraction skip; the GL-034 autoquit selection flipped from first-wins (forward-walk
  compensation) to plain overwrite — last-wins on the newest→oldest walk lands on the oldest
  idler, exactly ROM's `ch_quit = ch`. Part of INV-045 (CHAR-LIST-WALK-ORDER).
  ROM C: `src/update.c:661-786` + `src/db.c:2256-2257`. Python: `mud/game_loop.py:char_update`.
  Test: `tests/integration/test_update_c_parity.py::TestCharUpdateIterationOrder`.

### Added

- **INV-045 — CHAR-LIST-WALK-ORDER cross-file invariant filed** — documents the registry-order
  divergence class (ROM head-inserted `char_list`/`object_list` vs Python append-order
  registries) with a full site inventory: conforming (`violence_tick`, `obj_update`,
  `char_update`), open offenders (`mobile_update` → GL-042, `aggr` walk, `get_char_world`
  first-match in `mud/world/char_find.py`).

## [2.14.10] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **GL-040 — `obj_update` iterated `object_registry` oldest-first; ROM walks `object_list`
  newest-first** — ROM `src/db.c:2482-2483` (`create_object`) head-inserts every new object, so
  `src/update.c:919` (`obj_update`) visits the most-recently-created object first. Python iterated
  in append (creation) order — the reverse — diverging the shared Mitchell-Moore RNG draw order
  (per-affect `number_range(0,4)` level-fade rolls), same-tick decay message order, and ticking
  already-extracted container contents from the stale loop snapshot. Fixed by iterating
  `list(reversed(object_registry))` and skipping objects no longer in the registry (mirrors ROM's
  `extract_obj` list re-linking — a removed object is never revisited). Object-side twin of the
  `violence_tick` char-order fix (FINDING-009 facet 3).
  ROM C: `src/update.c:919` + `src/db.c:2482-2483`. Python: `mud/game_loop.py:obj_update`.
  Tests: `tests/integration/test_update_c_parity.py::TestObjUpdateIterationOrder`.

## [2.14.9] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **GL-039 — `obj_update` spill gate uses prototype `wear_flags` instead of runtime `wear_loc`** —
  ROM `src/update.c:1025-1026` uses `obj->wear_loc == WEAR_FLOAT` (runtime state) to decide
  whether to spill a floating container's contents on decay. Python had an extra branch checking
  the prototype `wear_flags & WEAR_FLOAT`, causing a non-floating disc in a room to dump its
  contents into the room rather than destroying them alongside the container via `extract_obj`.
  Fixed by removing the extra `elif` branch; the spill now fires only for `ITEM_CORPSE_PC` or
  `wear_loc == WEAR_FLOAT`, matching ROM exactly.
  ROM C: `src/update.c:1025-1026`. Python: `mud/game_loop.py:obj_update`.
  Test: `tests/integration/test_gl039_obj_update_spill_gate.py`.

## [2.14.8] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-061 — `do_flee` sector-based move cost, PC guard, and exhaustion check** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:3001-3002` calls `move_char(ch, door, FALSE)`, which in
  `src/act_move.c:115-193` deducts movement only for PCs using the sector-average
  formula `(movement_loss[in]+movement_loss[out])/2`, and returns early without moving
  if `ch->move < cost` (causing that flee attempt to fail). Python used a flat
  `max(0, char.move - c_div(char.max_move, 10))` applied to all characters after a
  successful flee. Three bugs: wrong formula (FIELD→FIELD = 2, not max_move/10 = 10
  for a level-10 PC); no PC guard (NPCs had move deducted); no exhaustion check
  (a PC with move=0 could always flee). Fixed by integrating the sector-based cost
  check inside the 6-attempt loop with a `continue` path mirroring `move_char`'s
  exhaustion early-return. Enforced by
  `tests/integration/test_fight061_flee_move_cost.py` (3 cases).

## [2.14.7] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-060 — `check_assist` NPC elif chain skips ASSIST_ALIGN/ASSIST_VNUM when ASSIST_RACE
  flag set but race doesn't match** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:139-150` evaluates the five NPC assist conditions as a flat `||` OR chain.
  Python used `elif` for the ASSIST_RACE / ASSIST_ALIGN / ASSIST_VNUM checks; when the
  ASSIST_RACE flag was set but the inner race predicate failed, the `elif` branch was entered
  (flag is truthy) and subsequent `elif` branches were silently skipped. A mob with both
  ASSIST_RACE and ASSIST_ALIGN (different race, same alignment as attacker) would fail to
  assist in Python, but would assist in ROM. The missed assist is also an MM RNG desync: the
  `number_bits(1)` skip draw and target-selection `number_range` loop are gated on
  `should_assist`. Fixed by converting the three `elif` checks to independent `if` checks,
  restoring ROM's flat OR semantics. Enforced by
  `tests/integration/test_fight060_check_assist_elif_chain.py` (2 cases: ASSIST_ALIGN fires
  despite ASSIST_RACE flag+mismatch; ASSIST_VNUM fires despite ASSIST_RACE flag+mismatch).

## [2.14.6] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-059 — injury-feedback messages missing from `apply_damage`** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:864-869` has a `default:` case in the `switch(victim->position)` block
  inside `damage()` that fires when the victim's position stays normal (not MORTAL/INCAP/
  STUNNED/DEAD). It delivers two optional messages to the victim: "That really did HURT!"
  when the hit exceeded `max_hit/4`, and "You sure are BLEEDING!" when current HP drops
  below `max_hit/4`. Python had no equivalent — the victim received no injury feedback for
  non-critical hits. Added both checks inside `apply_damage` after `apply_position_change`,
  guarded by `victim.position > Position.STUNNED` (the exact `default:` case condition).
  Enforced by `tests/test_combat.py::test_apply_damage_hurt_and_bleeding_messages` (4 cases).

## [2.14.5] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **INV-044 charm-master attacks own pet does not break follow** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:756-757` calls `stop_follower(victim)` inside `damage()` whenever
  `victim->master == ch` (the attacker is the victim's controller). This immediately breaks
  the charm/follow relationship when a PC attacks their own charmed pet. Python's
  `apply_damage` was missing this check entirely, so a master attacking their charmed mob
  would keep full control — the follow bond was never severed by the attack. Added
  `if getattr(victim, "master", None) is attacker: stop_follower(victim)` in `apply_damage`
  after the `set_fighting` block, matching ROM's exact position. Enforced by
  `tests/test_combat.py::test_apply_damage_charm_master_breaks_follow`.

## [2.14.4] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-058 spell/skill damage bypasses drunk/sanctuary/protection reductions** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:775-785` applies all three damage modifiers inside `damage()` for every
  caller: drunk PC takes 9/10 damage, sanctuary-buffed victim takes half damage, and
  protect_evil/good alignment checks reduce damage by 1/4. Python factored
  `apply_damage_reduction` into a helper only called from `one_hit` (the melee weapon path),
  so every spell handler (`fireball`, `flamestrike`, `earthquake`, `energy_drain`,
  `chain_lightning`, `lightning_bolt`, `magic_missile`, `ray_of_truth`, `cause_*`, etc.) that
  calls `apply_damage` directly bypassed all three reductions. Moved the reduction call into
  `apply_damage` (after `is_safe`, before parry/dodge — matching ROM fight.c:775-785 vs
  fight.c:793-801) and removed the pre-call from `one_hit` to prevent double-reduction on
  the melee path. All 25+ `apply_damage` callers now get correct reductions automatically.

## [2.14.3] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-057 double-RIV application in weapon attacks** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:804-816` calls `check_immune` exactly once inside `damage()`.
  Python split the combat pipeline across `attack_round` + `apply_damage`, with RIV applied
  in both halves: `attack_round` pre-applied resistance/vulnerability (former lines 615-623),
  then `apply_damage` applied it again. An IS_RESISTANT victim took `(1-1/3)^2 ≈ 44%` of
  raw damage instead of ROM's `1-1/3 ≈ 67%`. Removed the duplicate RIV block from
  `attack_round`; `apply_damage` now applies RIV exactly once for all callers.

## [2.14.2] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-056 `damage` soft-cap missing** —
  ROM `src/fight.c:717-720` applies two sequential soft-caps inside `damage()` before any
  other modifier: `if (dam > 35) dam = (dam-35)/2+35; if (dam > 80) dam = (dam-80)/2+80;`.
  Python's `apply_damage` had neither cap, so raw damage spikes above 35 landed unreduced —
  a 200-damage hit dealt 200 instead of ROM's capped 98, a 50-damage hit dealt 50 instead
  of 42. Caps added at the top of `apply_damage` (before `is_safe`), affecting all callers:
  weapon attacks, spells, kicks, mob-program damage.

## [2.14.1] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-055 `xp_compute` alignment mutation + multiplier snapshot** —
  `mud/groups/xp.py:xp_compute` had two divergences from ROM `src/fight.c:1878-1914`.
  (A) An early `if base_exp <= 0: return 0` skipped the alignment mutation entirely for kills where
  the victim is 10+ levels weaker (level_range < -9, base_exp == 0). ROM has no such early return —
  `UMAX(1, change)` forces alignment to shift by 1 even when base_exp is 0 and the raw change
  computes to 0, as long as `align_delta > 500` or `align_delta < -500`.
  (B) Python captured `gch_alignment` as a pre-mutation snapshot and used it in the XP multiplier
  branch conditions (`> 500`, `< -500`, `> 200`, `< -200`). ROM `src/fight.c:1916` reads
  `gch->alignment` post-mutation, so a character whose alignment crosses a threshold during the
  kill (e.g. 510→426 crossing the 500 boundary) gets a different XP rate in ROM vs Python.
  Fixed by removing the early return (alignment always runs; XP naturally computes to 0 when
  base_exp==0) and replacing the snapshot references in the multiplier with `post_alignment = gch.alignment`
  read after the alignment block.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-054 `do_flee` movement mechanism** —
  `mud/commands/combat.py:do_flee` used a fake dexterity-based `number_percent()` success roll
  (`50 + (dex - 13) * 5`) not present in ROM. ROM `src/fight.c:2986-3003` uses a 6-attempt
  `number_door()` loop: each attempt draws a random door (0–5), checks `EX_CLOSED` (bit 1, not bit 0),
  checks `number_range(0, ch->daze) != 0` to block on daze, and for NPCs checks `ROOM_NO_MOB`.
  Python also omitted the `POS_STANDING` reset when not fighting (ROM `:2979-2980`), and was
  checking `exit_info & 1` (EX_ISDOOR) instead of `& 2` (EX_CLOSED). Replaced entire exit-selection
  path with the ROM 6-attempt `number_door()` loop; added daze check, ROOM_NO_MOB guard, and
  position reset. Also updated `test_fight043_flee_xp_loss.py` and `test_flee_moves_character.py`
  to use canonical list-of-6 exits and `number_door` patches.

## [2.13.99] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-053 `check_assist` target-selection RNG increment** —
  `mud/combat/assist.py:check_assist` incremented `number` unconditionally after each visible
  group member, but ROM `src/fight.c:165` only increments inside the selection block (when the
  candidate becomes the new target). With 3+ group members and the 2nd skipped, Python made the
  3rd call with `number_range(0, 2)` where ROM uses `number_range(0, 1)` — desyncing the shared
  MM RNG stream for all subsequent combat events. Moved `number += 1` inside the selection
  if-block to match ROM.

## [2.13.98] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-052 `_kill_safety_message` NPC-attacker-vs-PC guard ordering** —
  `mud/commands/combat.py:_kill_safety_message` checked the charmed-mob guard before the
  safe-room check in the NPC-attacker branch. ROM `src/fight.c:1080-1093` checks safe-room
  (`:1083`) before the charmed-mob guard (`:1087`). Corner case affected: a charmed NPC in a
  safe room attacking a PC whose master is not fighting that PC — ROM returns "Not in this room."
  (safe-room wins); Python previously returned "Players are your friends!" (wrong message).
  Swapped the two checks to restore ROM ordering.

## [2.13.97] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-051 `_murder_safety_check` missing victim-NPC ACT_PET and AFF_CHARM non-owner guards** —
  `mud/commands/murder.py:_murder_safety_check` lacked the same two victim-NPC guards added to
  `is_safe` in FIGHT-050. ROM `do_murder` (line 2861) calls `is_safe(ch, victim)` first, which
  blocks murder of a pet NPC (ROM `:1059`: "But $N looks so cute and cuddly...") and murder of
  a charmed NPC by a non-owner (ROM `:1067`: "You don't own that monster."). Python bypasses
  `is_safe` and calls `_murder_safety_check` directly, so neither guard was reached for the
  murder path. Added a victim-NPC sub-block after the kill-stealing check with both guards.

## [2.13.96] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-050 `is_safe` missing three NPC-guard branches** — `mud/combat/safety.py:is_safe`
  was missing three ROM C guards from `src/fight.c:1040-1094`. (1) PC attacking a pet NPC
  (`ACT_PET` flag on victim) was not blocked — ROM line 1059 returns TRUE with "But $N looks
  so cute and cuddly...". (2) PC attacking a charmed NPC they don't own was not blocked — ROM
  line 1067 checks `AFF_CHARM && ch != victim->master`. (3) Charmed NPC attacking a PC whose
  master is not fighting that PC was not blocked — ROM lines 1087-1093 check
  `AFF_CHARM && master != NULL && master->fighting != victim` → "Players are your friends!".
  All three guards are now present in `is_safe`, bringing every call path (spells, backstab,
  kick, assist, mob specials) into parity alongside `do_kill`'s `_kill_safety_message` which
  already had them.

## [2.13.95] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-049 `_murder_safety_check` missing PC-vs-PC clan/level guards** — `mud/commands/murder.py:_murder_safety_check`
  had no PC-vs-PC branch. ROM `src/fight.c:1096-1121` blocks attacks when: (1) attacker is not
  clan-member ("Join a clan if you want to kill players."); (2) victim has KILLER/THIEF flag
  (attack allowed, bypass remaining checks); (3) victim is not clan-member ("They aren't in a
  clan, leave them alone."); (4) attacker level > victim level + 8 ("Pick on someone your own
  size."). Added the full PC-vs-PC waterfall guarded by `not char.is_npc and not victim.is_npc`.
  FIGHT-050 filed for remaining `mud/combat/safety.py:is_safe` gaps (ACT_PET, charm-ownership,
  NPC-charmed-PC-attack) deferred due to CRITICAL blast radius.

## [2.13.94] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **RECALL-002 `do_recall` skill improvement not called** — `mud/commands/session.py:do_recall`
  had `# TODO: check_improve(...)` stubs that never fired. ROM `src/act_move.c:1601` calls
  `check_improve(ch, gsn_recall, FALSE, 6)` on recall failure and line 1610 calls
  `check_improve(ch, gsn_recall, TRUE, 4)` on success. The recall skill now improves from use.

## [2.13.93] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **RECALL-001 `do_recall` XP floor bypass** — `mud/commands/session.py:do_recall` used
  `ch.exp -= lose` directly when recalling from combat, bypassing the XP floor.
  ROM `src/act_move.c:1609` calls `gain_exp(ch, 0 - lose)` which applies
  `UMAX(exp_per_level(ch), ch->exp + gain)` — XP can never drop below the level floor.
  A PC within 25-50 XP of their level floor would go below floor in Python but be
  clamped in ROM. Fixed by replacing direct subtraction with `gain_exp(ch, -lose)`.

## [2.13.92] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-048 `do_murder` victim yell never delivered** — `mud/commands/murder.py:do_murder`
  built the victim's help yell as a string and returned it to the attacker as the command
  response, instead of calling `do_yell(victim, ...)` area-wide. ROM `src/fight.c:2888`
  calls `do_function(victim, &do_yell, buf)` — the victim yells; all area characters hear
  "$n yells 'Help! I am being attacked by X!'". Also removed the extra "You attack $n!"
  message that ROM never sends to the attacker. Fix: replaced return-string approach with
  `do_yell(victim, yell_msg)` + `_push_message(victim, ...)` before `check_killer`.

## [2.13.91] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-047 `do_kick` missing `check_killer`** — `mud/commands/combat.py:do_kick`
  never called `check_killer(ch, victim)`. ROM `src/fight.c:3138` calls it
  unconditionally after both the success and failure branches. Added after `check_improve`.
  (Structural parity only — `do_kick` requires `char.fighting` to be set, so the
  fighting guard in check_killer fires and KILLER is never set in practice.)

## [2.13.90] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-046 `do_backstab` missing `check_killer`** — `mud/commands/combat.py:do_backstab`
  never called `check_killer(ch, victim)`. ROM `src/fight.c:2951` calls it before
  `WAIT_STATE` and the skill roll. Because `do_backstab` requires `char.fighting is None`,
  the check_killer fighting-guard does not fire — this was a real behavioral gap where a
  clan PC backstabbing another clan PC escaped the KILLER flag.

## [2.13.89] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-045 `do_trip` check_killer only on success** — `mud/commands/combat.py:do_trip`
  called `check_killer(ch, victim)` only inside the success branch. ROM `src/fight.c:2753`
  calls it unconditionally after both branches. Refactored to collect the message in a
  variable and call `check_killer` after the if/else block.

## [2.13.88] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-044 `do_bash` missing unconditional `check_killer`** — `mud/commands/combat.py:do_bash`
  was missing the `check_killer(ch, victim)` call at `src/fight.c:2486`. ROM calls it
  unconditionally after both the success and failure branches. Added after `check_improve`.
  (Note: `apply_damage` sets `attacker.fighting` before check_killer runs, so the KILLER flag
  is never actually set in practice — same in ROM C — but the structural parity is restored.)

## [2.13.87] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FIGHT-043 `do_flee` missing XP penalty** — `mud/commands/combat.py:do_flee` was
  missing the entire ROM XP-loss block (`src/fight.c:3010-3019`). On a successful flee
  by a PC, ROM emits "You fled from combat!" then: for thieves (`ch_class == 2`) runs a
  sneak check (`number_percent() < 3 * (level / 2)`) and emits "You snuck away safely."
  with no XP loss; otherwise emits "You lost 10 exp." and calls `gain_exp(ch, -10)`.
  Python emitted the flee message but skipped the entire penalty block. Five
  mutation-verified tests in `tests/integration/test_fight043_flee_xp_loss.py` lock all
  branches (warrior XP loss, thief sneak success, thief sneak fail, NPC unaffected).

## [2.13.86] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **MATH-002/003/004 hygiene (c_div parity)** — replaced `//` with `c_div` at 11 sites in
  `mud/combat/engine.py` (vampiric heal `dam // 2` → `c_div(dam, 2)`; weapon-flag effect
  dispatch `weapon_level // {2,4,5,6}` → `c_div(weapon_level, N)`) and
  `mud/skills/handlers.py` (`enchant_armor`/`enchant_weapon` fizzle thresholds
  `fail // {5,3,2}` → `c_div(fail, N)`). Operands are non-negative by construction; no
  observable behavioral change. Closes all open rows in `docs/parity/audits/MATH_AND_RNG.md`.

## [2.13.85] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **INV-043 NUKE-PETS-STOP-FIGHTING (cross-file)** — `mud/combat/death.py:_nuke_pets`
  now calls `stop_fighting(pet, both=True)` before removing the pet from
  `character_registry`. ROM `src/act_comm.c:nuke_pets` → `extract_char(pet, TRUE)`
  → `src/handler.c:stop_fighting(pet, TRUE)` clears all `fighting` pointers that
  targeted the pet; Python's manual extraction path was missing this sweep, leaving
  any character in combat with the charmed pet with a ghost `fighting` pointer after
  the pet was extracted. Two mutation-verified tests in
  `tests/integration/test_inv043_nuke_pets_stop_fighting.py` lock the contract (28
  enforced INVs, next free ID: INV-044).

## [2.13.84] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **INV-042 KILL-DEATH-XP-TRIGGER-ORDERING (cross-file)** — filed and locked
  the three-step call-order contract in `mud/combat/engine.py:_handle_death`:
  `group_gain` → `mp_death_trigger` → `raw_kill`. ROM `src/fight.c:883-924`
  mandates this sequence (XP while victim stats are intact, mob prog before
  extraction, raw_kill always last). Two mutation-verified call-order spy tests
  in `tests/integration/test_inv042_kill_death_xp_trigger_ordering.py` lock the
  ordering for both the TRIG_DEATH and no-trigger cases. Added INV-042 row to
  cross-file invariants tracker (27 enforced, next free ID: INV-043).

## [2.13.83] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **INV-006 position-ordering sub-contract (cross-file)** — locked the
  `stop_fighting` position-reset-then-`update_pos` ordering contract with two
  new enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_inv006_fighting_pointer_coherence.py`.
  ROM `src/fight.c:1448-1451` sets `fch->position` to `default_pos`/`POS_STANDING`
  *then* calls `update_pos(fch)`, so negative-HP characters end at their
  HP-driven position (DEAD/INCAP/etc.) rather than the reset value.
  Mutation-verified (swapping the two lines causes both new tests to go RED).
  Updated INV-006 tracker row with sub-contract description and cross-ref to
  INV-019 (the upward direction of the same edge).

## [2.13.82] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **`group_commands.py` stale `add_follower`/`stop_follower` dedup** — deleted
  local duplicate implementations from `mud/commands/group_commands.py`; both
  functions now imported from the canonical `mud.characters.follow` module.
  The local `stop_follower` only bit-cleared `affected_by` and never called
  `remove_spell_effect("charm person")` (diverging from ROM `affect_strip`),
  and the local `add_follower` silently returned early on any non-None master
  instead of stopping the prior follow first. Charm-strip path was unreachable
  via `do_follow` (charmed chars are blocked before `stop_follower` is called),
  but the duplication was a maintenance hazard.
- **Layer-A guard test** — `tests/test_follow_canonical.py` bans local
  redefinitions of `add_follower`/`stop_follower` in `group_commands.py` and
  asserts both are imported from `mud.characters.follow`.

## [2.13.81] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`__set_on=<vnum>`, `__set_on_val3=<n>`, `__set_on_val4=<n>` meta-commands** —
  new diff-harness primitives in both `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` and
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`. `__set_on=<vnum>` spawns a furniture object
  and sets `ch->on` / `char.on`; `__set_on_val3/4` override `value[3]`/`value[4]`
  (HP+move and mana bonus percents). Python side copies prototype value array to
  length-5 before override — mirrors C `create_object`'s clean copy to prevent
  the value-fallback mismatch documented in AGENTS.md.
- **`char_update_regen_furniture` diff-harness scenario and golden** — SLEEPING L5
  PC on bench (vnum 3134) with `value[3]=150`, `value[4]=200`. C oracle confirms
  ROM src/update.c:217-218/299-300/350-351: HP+15 (`* 150/100`), mana+34
  (`* 200/100`), move+42 (`* 150/100`) per pulse. Asymmetric multipliers make a
  value-index swap immediately detectable. 40 smoke tests pass.
- **`test_drive_python_replay_furniture_bonus_scales_regen`** — unit test locking
  the three furniture-bonus branches; traces against C-oracle values.

## [2.13.80] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`__set_heal_rate=N` and `__set_mana_rate=N` meta-commands** — new diff-harness
  primitives in both `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` and `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`.
  Set `room->heal_rate` / `room->mana_rate` multipliers on the test room directly,
  exercising the `gain * rate / 100` regen branches in `hit_gain`/`move_gain` and
  `mana_gain` respectively.
- **`char_update_regen_room_rates` diff-harness scenario** — SLEEPING mage,
  `heal_rate=50` and `mana_rate=200`. C oracle confirms the asymmetry:
  `heal_rate` scales HP (+5/pulse) and move (+14/pulse); `mana_rate` scales
  only mana (+34/pulse, capped at max_mana on pulse 3). Python already correct.
- **`test_drive_python_replay_room_rates_heal_and_mana_independent`** unit test.

## [2.13.79] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **GL-038: plague tick gate used bitmask instead of spell-affect list** —
  `_char_update_tick_effects` (`mud/game_loop.py`) gated the plague tick on
  `has_affect(AffectFlag.PLAGUE)` (bitmask check) instead of ROM's
  `is_affected(ch, gsn_plague)` (spell affect list check). A character with
  innate `AFF_PLAGUE` in `affected_by` but no spell-affect entry — common for
  area-file mobs — would: in C, keep the bitmask forever and regen at ÷8 every
  pulse with no tick messages; in Python, print writhe messages and *clear the
  bitmask* after pulse 1, losing the ÷8 penalty. Fixed by gating on the spell
  list and removing the orphan-bit clearing branch. Regen divisors in
  `hit_gain`/`mana_gain`/`move_gain` correctly keep the bitmask check (matching
  ROM's `IS_AFFECTED`). Diff-harness scenario `char_update_regen_plague`
  (GL-038 C oracle) + `test_drive_python_replay_plague_affect_divides_regen_by_eight`.

### Added

- **`char_update_regen_plague` diff-harness scenario** — SLEEPING mage with
  orphan AFF_PLAGUE bit (8388608 = 1<<23) set via `__add_affect`. Three
  `__char_update` pulses confirm PLAGUE ÷8 divisor and flag persistence:
  HP+1/pulse, mana+2/pulse, move+3/pulse. C oracle: flag never cleared (no
  spell entry), tick never fires.
- **`char_update_regen_slow` diff-harness scenario** — SLEEPING mage with
  AFF_SLOW bit (536870912 = 1<<29) set via `__add_affect`. Three
  `__char_update` pulses confirm SLOW ÷2 divisor (same branch as HASTE):
  HP+5/pulse, mana+8/pulse, move+14/pulse. No tick side-effects for SLOW.
- **`test_drive_python_replay_plague_affect_divides_regen_by_eight`** and
  **`test_drive_python_replay_slow_affect_halves_regen_by_two`** unit tests.

## [2.13.78] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`__add_affect=<bit>` meta-command** — new diff-harness primitive in both
  `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` and `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`. ORs the
  given AFF_* bitmask into `ch->affected_by` / `char.affected_by` without
  creating a spell AFFECT_DATA entry. Lets scenarios exercise the `IS_AFFECTED`
  regen divisor branches (POISON÷4, PLAGUE÷8, HASTE/SLOW÷2) independently of
  the tick-handler spell-affect linked list.
- **`char_update_regen_poison` diff-harness scenario** — SLEEPING mage with
  AFF_POISON bit (4096) set via `__add_affect=4096`. Three `__char_update`
  pulses confirm POISON ÷4 divisor: HP+2/pulse, mana+4/pulse, move+7/pulse.
- **`char_update_regen_haste` diff-harness scenario** — SLEEPING mage with
  AFF_HASTE bit (2097152) set via `__add_affect=2097152`. Three `__char_update`
  pulses confirm HASTE ÷2 divisor: HP+5/pulse, mana+8/pulse, move+14/pulse.
- **`test_drive_python_replay_poison_affect_halves_regen_by_four`** and
  **`test_drive_python_replay_haste_affect_halves_regen_by_two`** unit tests —
  each verifies HP/mana/move gain in one pulse against C-oracle ground truth.

## [2.13.77] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`char_update_regen_hungry_thirsty` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle
  scenario exercising the `COND_HUNGER == 0` and `COND_THIRST == 0` halving
  branches in `hit_gain`, `mana_gain`, and `move_gain`. Mage (class 0) at level 5,
  sleeping, HP=1/mana=5/move=5 with both conditions zeroed. Three `__char_update`
  pulses confirm dual-halving: HP+2/pulse, mana+4/pulse, move+7/pulse vs the
  sleeping baseline of HP+10/mana+17/move+28 (each effectively ÷4 via two
  sequential C integer divisions). SLEEPING position chosen to keep per-pulse gains
  nonzero (STANDING ÷4 floors to 0, masking the halving).
- **`test_drive_python_replay_hunger_thirst_zero_halves_regen_twice`** unit test —
  verifies all three gains against C-oracle ground truth in a single pulse.

## [2.13.76] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`char_update_regen_resting` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle scenario
  exercising the `POS_RESTING` position branch in `hit_gain`, `mana_gain`, and
  `move_gain`. Mage (class 0) at level 5, resting, HP=5/mana=30/move=20 — three
  `__char_update` pulses confirm resting regen (HP+5/pulse, mana+8/pulse,
  move+21/pulse). Resting rates are exactly half sleeping (`gain//2` for HP/mana;
  `DEX//2` vs `DEX` for move). Completes the sleeping/resting/standing regen
  position-branch coverage across all three gain functions.
- **`test_drive_python_replay_char_position_resting_halves_all_gain`** unit test —
  verifies all three resting gain values against C-oracle ground truth in a single
  `__char_update` pulse.

## [2.13.75] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`char_update_regen_sleeping` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle scenario
  exercising the `POS_SLEEPING` position branch in `hit_gain`, `mana_gain`, and
  `move_gain`. Mage (class 0) at level 5, sleeping, HP=5/mana=30/move=20 — three
  `__char_update` pulses confirm sleeping regen (HP+10/pulse, mana+17/pulse,
  move+28/pulse) vs standing (HP+2, mana+4, move+15). First scenario to exercise
  the position switch arms across all three gain functions simultaneously.
- **`__char_position=<n>` meta-command** — new harness meta-command setting the
  PC's position (4=sleeping, 5=resting, 8=standing) in both `pyreplay.py` and
  `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`. Mirrors the existing `__mob_position=` for NPCs.
  Unit-tested via `test_drive_python_replay_char_position_meta_affects_hit_gain`.

## [2.13.74] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`char_update_regen_fast_healing` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle scenario
  exercising the roll-dependent HP-gain path with `fast healing` active. Warrior
  (class 3, `hp_max=15`, level-6 req satisfied), HP=5/max=20, three `__char_update`
  pulses with `__seed=12345`. C oracle confirms HP progression 5→10→18→20 (rolls 24,
  97, 90 from seed 12345). Symmetric follow-on to the `char_update_regen_meditation`
  scenario; confirms `_get_skill_percent` level gating is correct on the HP side.
- **`__char_class=<n>` meta-command** — new harness meta-command setting the PC's
  class index (0=mage, 1=cleric, 2=thief, 3=warrior) in both `pyreplay.py` and
  `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`. Required to exercise class-specific `hit_gain`/
  `mana_gain` paths. Unit-tested via `test_drive_python_replay_char_class_meta_affects_hit_gain`.

## [2.13.73] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **`_get_skill_percent` level-gating parity** — Python's `_get_skill_percent`
  returned the raw skill value regardless of whether the character met the
  class-specific level requirement. ROM C `src/handler.c get_skill()` returns 0
  when `ch->level < skill_table[sn].skill_level[ch->class]`. Python now checks
  `skill_registry` metadata (populated from `ROM_SKILL_METADATA` `"levels"` key)
  and returns 0 if the level requirement is not met. Affects `hit_gain`
  (fast_healing) and `mana_gain` (meditation) in `game_loop.py`.

### Added

- **`char_update_regen_meditation` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle scenario
  exercising the roll-dependent mana-gain path with `meditation` active. Level-6
  mage, mana=20/max=100, three `__char_update` pulses with `__seed=12345`
  injected before the first pulse to resync RNG state against C. Confirms skill
  bonus application and the `_get_skill_percent` level-gating fix are parity-
  correct against ROM C. 30 scenarios, 48 C-oracle tests passing.

## [2.13.72] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **`_apply_regeneration` RNG gating parity** — `_apply_regeneration` was calling
  `hit_gain`/`mana_gain` unconditionally, consuming one `number_percent()` RNG
  roll each per tick even when the character was already at max HP/mana. ROM C
  `src/update.c:698-712` gates the gain functions inside
  `if (ch->hit < ch->max_hit)` etc. — those branches are never entered at max,
  so no RNG is consumed. Python now mirrors this gating; characters at full HP
  or mana no longer advance the RNG state. Enforced by
  `TestApplyRegenerationRNGGating::test_rng_not_consumed_when_hit_at_max`.

### Added

- **`char_update_regen` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle scenario exercising
  HP/mana/move regeneration via three `__char_update` pulses on a level-5
  character starting at HP=5, mana=30, move=20. Confirms the regen gain
  formulas (`hit_gain`/`mana_gain`/`move_gain`) and the RNG-gating fix are
  parity-correct against ROM C. 29 scenarios, 46 C-oracle tests passing.
- **`__hp=N` meta-command** — added to `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` and
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`. Sets `ch->hit` (and `ch->max_hit` if lower)
  directly, mirroring `__mana=N`. Used to place a character below max HP for
  regen scenarios.
- **`__move=N` meta-command** — added to `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` and
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`. Sets `ch->move` (and `ch->max_move` if
  lower) directly, completing the resource-setter trio with `__mana=` and `__hp=`.

## [2.13.71] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`char_update_condition_decay` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle scenario
  exercising tick-based hunger/thirst/drunk drain via `__char_update`. Sets
  COND_HUNGER=2, COND_THIRST=2, COND_DRUNK=2, runs two `char_update` pulses;
  the second tick drains all three to 0, producing "You are hungry.",
  "You are thirsty.", "You are sober." in ROM's DRUNK→FULL→THIRST→HUNGER
  dispatch order (`src/update.c:755-759`). Confirms `gain_condition` parity
  for the negative-delta drain path.
- **`__cond_drunk=N` meta-command** — added to both `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`
  and `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` (`COND_DRUNK` index 0) so scenarios can
  set the drunk condition directly. Mirrors the existing `__cond_hunger`,
  `__cond_thirst`, `__cond_full` meta-commands.
  28 scenarios now, 47 C-oracle tests passing.

## [2.13.70] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **EFFECTS-005: `poison_effect` poison affect missing** — `poison_effect` TARGET_CHAR
  was not applying the ROM poison affect (ROM `src/effects.c:461-477`):
  `affect_join` with AFF_POISON, -1 STR, duration=level/2,
  wear_off="You feel less sick.". The `# TODO` stub replaced with
  `apply_spell_effect(SpellEffect("poison", ...))`. Room broadcast
  `"$n looks very ill."` added with PERS masking via `act_to_room`.
  Completes the EFFECTS_C_AUDIT (003/004/005 all closed; audit now 100%).
  4 tests added (`test_poison_affect_applied_on_failed_save`,
  `test_poison_affect_not_applied_on_saved`, `test_poison_wear_off_message`,
  `test_poison_duration_scales_with_level`).

## [2.13.69] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **EFFECTS-004: `fire_effect` fire breath blindness missing** — `fire_effect` TARGET_CHAR
  was not applying the ROM fire-breath blind affect (ROM `src/effects.c:319-336`):
  `affect_to_char` with AFF_BLIND, -4 hitroll, duration=number_range(0, level/10),
  wear_off="The smoke leaves your eyes.". The `!IS_AFFECTED(victim, AFF_BLIND)` guard
  was present but the affect itself was a TODO stub. Replaced with
  `apply_spell_effect(SpellEffect("fire breath", ...))`. Room broadcast
  `"$n is blinded by smoke!"` added with PERS masking via `act_to_room`.
  5 tests added (`test_fire_breath_blind_applied_on_failed_save`,
  `test_fire_breath_duration_bounded`, `test_fire_breath_skipped_when_already_blind`,
  `test_fire_breath_not_applied_on_saved`, `test_fire_breath_wear_off_message`).

## [2.13.68] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **EFFECTS-003: `cold_effect` chill touch affect missing** — `cold_effect` TARGET_CHAR
  was not applying the ROM chill-touch affect (ROM `src/effects.c:215-231`):
  `affect_join` with -1 STR, duration=6, wear_off="You feel less cold.". The `# TODO`
  stub replaced with `apply_spell_effect(SpellEffect("chill touch", ...))`.
  Room broadcast `"$n turns blue and shivers."` added with PERS masking via `act_to_room`.
  3 tests added (`test_chill_touch_affect_applied_on_failed_save`,
  `test_chill_touch_affect_not_applied_on_saved`, `test_chill_touch_wear_off_message`).

## [2.13.67] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **EFFECTS-001: `cold_effect` hunger fill missing** — `cold_effect` TARGET_CHAR
  was silently skipping `gain_condition(victim, COND_HUNGER, dam/20)` (ROM
  `src/effects.c:235`). The `# TODO` comment is now wired: `gain_condition` is
  called with a positive delta (ROM C uses positive fill, not a drain) when a
  player is hit by cold magic.
- **EFFECTS-002: `fire_effect` thirst fill missing** — `fire_effect` TARGET_CHAR
  was silently skipping `gain_condition(victim, COND_THIRST, dam/20)` (ROM
  `src/effects.c:341`). Wired in the same pass. Both gaps were marked ✅ COMPLETE
  in the audit doc despite the `# TODO` in code — stale ✅ corrected in
  `docs/parity/EFFECTS_C_AUDIT.md`.

## [2.13.66] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`drink_eat_condition_lifecycle` diff-harness scenario** — 8-step scenario
  exercising `do_drink` (fountain) and `do_eat` (bread) with condition threshold
  messages: "Your thirst is quenched." (COND_THIRST > 40 after drinking) and
  "You are no longer hungry." (COND_HUNGER 0→positive edge on eating, ROM
  `src/act_obj.c:1331`). C golden captured; 27 scenarios, 46 C-oracle tests.
- **`__cond_hunger=<n>` meta-command** added to `diffmain.c` and `pyreplay.py`,
  completing the THIRST/FULL/HUNGER injection trio for diff-harness scenarios.

### Fixed

- **`do_eat` condition read path** — `consumption.py` was reading condition from
  `getattr(ch, "condition", None)` (a shadow attribute) while `do_drink` correctly
  read from `ch.pcdata.condition`. Fixed `do_eat` to use `ch.pcdata.condition`
  consistently with `do_drink`, matching ROM `ch->pcdata->condition` access pattern.
- **`pyreplay.py` condition meta-commands** — `__cond_full=`, `__cond_thirst=`,
  `__cond_hunger=` now write to `char.pcdata.condition` instead of a shadow
  `char.condition` attribute that `do_drink`/`do_eat` never read. The meta-commands
  were previously silent no-ops for drink behavior.

## [2.13.65] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **FINDING-033: `( N)` object grouping in `look` output** — `drive_python_replay`
  never set `char.comm`, so `COMM_COMBINE` was absent and `show_list_to_char` listed
  each object individually instead of grouping identical objects with `( N) ...`
  prefix (ROM `src/act_info.c:130-243 show_list_to_char`). Root cause: harness-setup
  divergence, not a game-engine bug — Python `show_list_to_char` already had correct
  combine logic. Fix: `char.comm = CommFlag.COMBINE | CommFlag.PROMPT` in
  `drive_python_replay`, mirroring `diffmain.c:462 ch->comm = COMM_COMBINE|COMM_PROMPT`.
  `test_generated_no_rng_sequences_match_live_c` xfail removed; Hypothesis state-machine
  test is now fully green.
- New enforcement test: `test_drive_python_replay_comm_combine_groups_identical_room_objects`
  in `tests/test_diff_harness_unit.py`.

## [2.13.64] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`shop_sell_keeper_broke` C-oracle golden captured** — the one remaining
  skipped diff-harness scenario now has a C golden and passes (was skipping;
  diff harness is now 0 skipped).
- **`charm_person_lifecycle` diff-harness scenario** — new C-oracle guard
  exercising the full charm/follower lifecycle: `__mload=3005` → `__charm_mob=1`
  (bypasses immunity, sets `add_follower` + AFF_CHARM + `master`) →
  2× `__char_update` (charm expires via `affect_remove`, NOT `stop_follower`) →
  golden confirms `master` remains set on the mob after AFF_CHARM clears
  (ROM invariant: affect expiry does not detach followers).
- **`__charm_mob=<duration>` meta-command** added to both `diffmain.c` and
  `pyreplay.py` — directly charms the first NPC in the room with a given duration,
  bypassing spell cast / immunity checks. Used by the charm lifecycle scenario.
- **`master` field added to `CharSnap`** (`tools/diff_harness/schema.py`,
  `pysnap.py`, `diffmain.c`) — snapshots now record the mob's `ch->master`
  pointer (as a char key). Backward-compatible: old goldens default to `null`.
- **`FINDING-033` documented** — Hypothesis `test_generated_no_rng_sequences_match_live_c`
  found that Python `do_look` lists identical room objects individually while ROM C
  groups them with `( N) ...` prefix (`show_list_to_char`). Test marked
  `xfail(strict=False)` pending fix.

## [2.13.63] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **`affect_expiry_lifecycle` C-oracle golden captured** — diff-harness scenario is now
  live (was skipping; the C binary was not built). Building the diffshim and running capture
  revealed two parity bugs immediately:
  - **Affect shadow location wrong for DEX/INT/WIS spells** (`mud/models/character.py`
    `sync_spell_effect_to_affected`): `Stat.DEX=3` so `stat_int + 1 = 4 = APPLY_WIS`;
    fixed by a proper `_STAT_TO_APPLY` dict (STR→1, DEX→2, INT→3, WIS→4, CON→5).
    Affected spells: `haste`, `slow`. Display now correctly shows "dexterity" not "wisdom".
  - **Affect list was FIFO instead of LIFO** (`sync_spell_effect_to_affected` and
    `Character.affect_to_char`): ROM C `affect_to_char` head-inserts (`paf_new->next =
    ch->affected`); Python was using `append`. Fixed by `insert(0, ...)`. Newest spell
    now appears first in `do_affects` output matching C. Regression: none (27-caller suite
    clean, 5504 pass).
  - **Sanctuary missing wear-off message** (`mud/skills/handlers.py`): `SpellEffect` had
    no `wear_off_message`; ROM C `const.c:1438` has `msg_off = "The white aura around
    your body fades."`. Added.
- **`handler.py:reset_char` stat location matching corrected**: secondary stat-apply blocks
  used `int(Stat.DEX) + 1 = 4` to match equipment APPLY_DEX locations (ROM C stores 2);
  replaced with explicit `APPLY_STR/DEX/INT/WIS/CON` constants.
- Two new enforcement tests: `test_dex_stat_modifier_shadow_uses_apply_dex` and
  `test_affected_list_lifo_order` (both in `tests/test_handler_affects_rom_parity.py`).

## [2.13.62] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **diff-harness scenario `affect_expiry_lifecycle`** — new scenario exercising spell affect
  bitvector set/clear across the full expiry lifecycle (sanctuary + haste at level 40 mage):
  `cast sanctuary` → `cast haste` (both AFF_SANCTUARY and AFF_HASTE set) →
  `__set_affect_duration=0` + `__char_update` (both cleared on expiry). Skips until a C
  golden is captured; provides the first harness coverage of affect bitvector lifecycle.
- **`__mana=N` meta-command** in diff-harness pyreplay and C shim (`diffmain.c`):
  sets the PC's mana (and raises `max_mana` if lower) directly, enabling multi-spell
  scenarios where the harness default of 100 mana is insufficient.
- Unit test `test_drive_python_replay_mana_meta_sets_mana_and_max_mana` verifying the
  new meta-command.

## [2.13.61] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **INV-015 affect-tick sub-contract enforcement** (`tests/integration/test_inv015_affect_tick_lifecycle.py`):
  probe of `src/update.c:762-786` confirmed both contracts are correctly implemented;
  two new enforcement tests lock them permanently:
  - `test_rng_slot_consumed_per_duration_positive_affect` — GL-026 regression guard:
    `number_range(0,4)` is called unconditionally for every `duration>0` affect before
    the `level>0` check (ROM C `&&` left-to-right; swapping operands would desync the
    global RNG stream for level=0 affects across the entire tick).
  - `test_msg_off_dedup_suppresses_all_but_last_same_type_affect` — dedup guard
    (`src/update.c:774-775`): only the last consecutive same-type expiring affect emits
    `msg_off`; prior same-type entries are silently removed.

## [2.13.60] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **INV-041 — Shopkeeper pShop coherence** (`mud/combat/safety.py`,
  `mud/world/world_state.py`, `mud/loaders/shop_loader.py`): ROM
  `src/fight.c:1040 is_safe` blocks attacks on any mob whose
  `pIndexData->pShop != NULL`. Python had two independent bugs:
  (1) `world_state.py` and `shop_loader.py` populated `shop_registry` but never
  wrote back `MobIndex.pShop` on the prototype, so every production shopkeeper
  had `pShop = None`; (2) `safety.py` only checked `victim.pShop` (absent on
  `MobInstance`) — the field lives on the prototype. Fixed by writing
  `mob_registry[keeper].pShop = shop` in both loaders after registering the shop,
  and widening `is_safe` to check `victim.prototype.pShop`. Enforcement test:
  `tests/integration/test_inv041_shopkeeper_psop_coherence.py`.

## [2.13.59] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`__mobile_update` meta-command** (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`,
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): runs one `mobile_update()` pulse (NPC AI,
  TRIG_RANDOM, TRIG_DELAY) in both the C shim and Python replay. ROM
  `src/update.c:408`.
- **`__mob_delay=N` meta-command** (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`,
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): sets `mob->mprog_delay` on the first NPC in
  the room, priming the TRIG_DELAY countdown before `__mobile_update`.
- **C-oracle diff-harness scenario `mob_random_trigger`** — verifies TRIG_RANDOM
  fires unconditionally each `mobile_update` tick when `position == default_pos`
  and `trig_phrase=101`. Golden captured, Python parity confirmed on first try.
- **C-oracle diff-harness scenario `mob_delay_trigger`** — verifies TRIG_DELAY
  fires when `mprog_delay` reaches 0 on a `mobile_update` tick, matching ROM
  `src/mob_prog.c:mp_delay_trigger`. Golden captured, Python parity confirmed.
- Removed stale dev-run golden `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_death_test.golden.json`
  (leftover from pre-commit c49ccff1; superseded by `mob_death_trigger.golden.json`).

## [2.13.58] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`__instant_kill` meta-command** (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`,
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): delivers a killing blow to the first NPC in the
  room via `damage(ch, mob, mob->hit+1, TYPE_HIT, DAM_BASH, TRUE)` / `apply_damage(…
  mob.hit+1, DamageType.BASH, dt=1000)`, exercising the full death path (TRIG_DEATH,
  group_gain, corpse, raw_kill) in a single deterministic step.
- **C-oracle diff-harness scenario `mob_kill_trigger`** — verifies TRIG_KILL fires on
  the first combat hit even when `dam=0` (miss), matching ROM `src/fight.c` dispatch
  via `kill` command. Golden captured and Python parity confirmed.
- **C-oracle diff-harness scenario `mob_death_trigger`** — verifies TRIG_DEATH fires
  after `group_gain`/XP but before `raw_kill`, with mob position temporarily
  STANDING, matching ROM `src/fight.c:918-922`. Golden captured and Python parity
  confirmed.
- **`mob_has_trigger(mob, trigger)`** (`mud/mobprog.py`): public helper mirroring
  ROM's `HAS_TRIGGER` macro; used to guard the TRIG_DEATH position-reset in
  `_handle_death`.

### Fixed

- **TRIG_DEATH ordering** (`mud/combat/engine.py`): trigger was firing in
  `apply_damage` before `group_gain`/XP, inverting the RNG sequence vs ROM C.
  Moved into `_handle_death` after `group_gain`, guarded by `mob_has_trigger`.
- **`death_cry` default message** (`mud/combat/death.py`): `message_template` was
  initialized to case-0's `"$n hits the ground … DEAD."` instead of ROM's pre-switch
  default `"You hear $n's death cry."` — `number_bits(4)` rolls 8–15 and cases 2–7
  where the body part is absent now correctly produce the death-cry message. Cases
  2–7 also converted from chained fallthrough to unconditional per-case handling,
  matching ROM's `break` after each `if (part) { … }` block.
- **`xp_compute` logon=0 bug** (`mud/groups/xp.py`): `logon=0` (uninitialized)
  was treated as Unix epoch, making `elapsed` ~1.75 billion seconds and clamping
  `time_per_level` to 12 instead of ROM's 10 for a fresh level-5 character. Changed
  check from `is not None` to truthiness, consistent with `advancement.py` and
  `handler.py`.
- **Snapshot filtering of dead chars** (`tools/diff_harness/pysnap.py`): chars with
  `room=None` (extracted by `raw_kill`) are now omitted from the snapshot, matching
  the C shim which only records chars still in the game world.

## [2.13.57] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`_room_occupant_line` FIGHTING branch unit tests** (`tests/integration/test_do_look_command.py`):
  all four ROM `src/act_info.c:404-416` POS_FIGHTING discriminant branches now have
  direct unit coverage — `thin air??` (fighting==NULL), `YOU!` (fighting==observer),
  `Name.` (same room), and `someone who left??` (different room). The `YOU!` path
  was previously exercised only by C-oracle golden replay.

## [2.13.56] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`__mob_hp=<n>` meta-command** (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`,
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): sets the first NPC's current hit points to
  `<n>` without touching `max_hit`. Enables HPCNT-threshold staging without
  combat-RNG dependency.
- **TRIG_SURR C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_surr_trigger.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_surr_trigger.golden.json`): confirms `mp_surr_trigger`
  fires when a PC surrenders to a mob with `TRIG_SURR` set. The mob acknowledges
  the surrender (no retaliation) instead of retaliating with `multi_hit`
  (`src/fight.c:3235-3241`). Python and C agree.
- **TRIG_FIGHT C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_fight_trigger.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_fight_trigger.golden.json`): confirms `mp_fight_trigger`
  fires each `violence_update` round after the NPC's `multi_hit`, dispatched from
  `src/fight.c:92-98` (INV-026 dispatch site). Python and C agree.
- **TRIG_HPCNT C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_hpcnt_trigger.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_hpcnt_trigger.golden.json`): confirms `mp_hprct_trigger`
  fires when mob HP falls below the percent threshold (`100*mob->hit/mob->max_hit
  < atoi(trig_phrase)`, `src/mob_prog.c:1357`). Uses `__mob_hp=10` to stage mob
  below the 50% threshold. Python and C agree.

### Fixed

- **`_room_occupant_line` fighting-target string** (`mud/world/look.py`): the
  `FIGHTING` position branch now correctly outputs `"YOU!"` when the mob is
  targeting the observer (mirroring `src/act_info.c:408`), appends `"."` for a
  same-room non-observer target (`:411-413`), and falls back to `"thin air??"` or
  `"someone who left??"` for the two edge cases. Previously only called
  `describe_character(observer, fighting)` which returned `"You"` instead of
  `"YOU!"`.

## [2.13.55] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **TRIG_ACT C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_act_trigger.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_act_trigger.golden.json`): confirms `mp_act_trigger` fires
  when a PC's `do_stand` emits `act("$n stands up.", ...)` and the mob's trig_phrase
  appears in the formatted room message (`src/comm.c:2385`, `src/mob_prog.c:1183-1197`).
  Python and C agree.
- **TRIG_BRIBE C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_bribe_trigger.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_bribe_trigger.golden.json`): confirms `mp_bribe_trigger`
  fires when the silver amount given meets the threshold (`amount >= atoi(trig_phrase)`,
  `src/act_obj.c:735`). Python and C agree.
- **TRIG_GIVE C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_give_trigger.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_give_trigger.golden.json`): confirms `mp_give_trigger` fires
  on object give with vnum-based trig_phrase matching (`src/mob_prog.c:1207-1242`).
  Python and C agree.

## [2.13.54] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`__mob_position=<pos>` meta-command** (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`,
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): sets the first NPC in the PC's current room
  to position `<pos>` (e.g. 5=RESTING, 8=STANDING). Enables diff-harness scenarios
  that gate `TRIG_EXIT`/`TRIG_GREET` (position-conditional) vs `TRIG_EXALL`/`TRIG_GRALL`
  (unconditional).
- **TRIG_EXALL C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_movement_triggers_exall.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_movement_triggers_exall.golden.json`): confirms ROM
  `mp_exit_trigger` fires EXALL unconditionally regardless of mob position while EXIT
  is gated on `mob->position == default_pos && can_see(mob, ch)` (`src/mob_prog.c:1262-1276`).
- **TRIG_GREET/GRALL C-oracle scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_movement_triggers_greet_grall.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_movement_triggers_greet_grall.golden.json`): confirms
  `mp_greet_trigger` GREET/GRALL dispatch — GREET fires when mob is at `default_pos`,
  GRALL fires as the else-if fallback (`src/mob_prog.c:1325-1345`).

### Fixed

- **`_room_occupant_line` position suffix** (`mud/world/look.py`): mobs at non-default
  positions now render with ROM-correct suffix (e.g. `" is resting here."`,
  `" is here."`) and initial-cap, matching `show_char_to_char_0`
  (`src/act_info.c:247-424`). Previously all mobs fell back to bare `describe_character`
  with no suffix. Dark-room path also updated to use `_room_occupant_line` (was
  calling `describe_character` directly).
- **`__mob_prog` LIFO ordering** (`tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): `__mob_prog`
  meta-command now prepends programs (`insert(0, prog)`) to match ROM C's
  `prog->next = mob->pIndexData->mprogs` prepend semantics. Previously appended
  (FIFO), diverging from C when EXIT and EXALL were both present.

## [2.13.53] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Diff-harness movement trigger scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/mob_movement_triggers.json`,
  `tests/data/golden/diff/mob_movement_triggers.golden.json`): C-oracle ground truth for
  `TRIG_EXIT` (direction 0, fires + blocks northward movement) and `TRIG_GRALL` (100%, fires
  on PC arrival). Confirms ROM `mp_exit_trigger` return-blocks movement
  (`src/act_move.c:move_char`) and `mp_greet_trigger` GRALL path dispatch
  (`src/mob_prog.c:1342-1345`). 5,479 tests pass.

## [2.13.52] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit exit/exall/grall mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added three runtime
  probes confirming OLC-created `exit`, `exall`, and `grall` mobprogs survive
  `spawn_mob` and reach the correct ROM dispatch paths — EXIT gated on mob
  position + visibility (`src/mob_prog.c:1262-1269`), EXALL unconditional
  (`src/mob_prog.c:1271-1276`), GRALL as the fallback branch in
  `mp_greet_trigger` when the mob is not at `default_pos`
  (`src/mob_prog.c:1333-1345`).

## [2.13.51] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit kill/death mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing OLC-created `kill` and `death` mobprogs survive `spawn_mob`
  and are selected from ROM's `damage()` trigger dispatch path when an NPC
  victim first enters combat and then dies.

## [2.13.50] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit surrender mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `surr` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and is
  selected by the player-facing `do_surrender` path before ROM's NPC
  ignore/retaliation fallback.

## [2.13.49] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit fight/hpcnt mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing OLC-created `fight` and `hpcnt` mobprogs survive `spawn_mob`
  and are selected from ROM's `violence_update` trigger dispatch path after
  `multi_hit` / `check_assist`.

## [2.13.48] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit give mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `give` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and is
  selected by the player-facing object `do_give` path with the given object as
  the ROM `arg1`.

## [2.13.47] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit bribe mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `bribe` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and is
  selected by the player-facing money `do_give` path at the ROM bribe
  threshold.

## [2.13.46] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit act mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `act` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and is
  selected by the player-facing `do_stand` act-line dispatch path.

## [2.13.45] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit speech mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `speech` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and is
  selected by the player-facing `do_say` path with the raw spoken phrase.

## [2.13.44] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit greet mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `greet` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and is
  selected when a PC enters the spawned mob's room through ROM's
  `mp_greet_trigger` movement path.

## [2.13.43] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Class 11 MEdit mobprog runtime coverage**
  (`tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py`): added a runtime
  probe showing an OLC-created `entry` mobprog survives `spawn_mob` and fires
  through directional movement's ROM `TRIG_ENTRY` path.

## [2.13.42] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`TABLES-004` MEdit mobprog trigger flag values** (`mud/commands/build.py`):
  `addmprog` now sets ROM-correct `mprog_flags` values from
  `src/tables.c:mprog_flags[]` / `src/merc.h:TRIG_*`, so builder-created
  `entry`, `speech`, `greet`, and related mobprogs use the same bits the
  runtime `HAS_TRIGGER` checks.

## [2.13.41] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`MOVE-007` / `ENTER-020` NPC entry-trigger precondition**
  (`mud/world/movement.py`): directional and portal movement now dispatch NPC
  `TRIG_ENTRY` mobprogs only when `mprog_flags` includes `Trigger.ENTRY`,
  matching ROM `HAS_TRIGGER(ch, TRIG_ENTRY)` in `src/act_move.c:240` and
  `src/act_enter.c:219`.

## [2.13.40] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`ENTER-019` portal follower visibility gate** (`mud/world/movement.py`):
  portal followers now attempt the recursive portal enter before their own
  destination visibility check, matching ROM `src/act_enter.c:177-198`.
  Directional followers still require `can_see_room`, matching
  `src/act_move.c:218`.

## [2.13.39] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`FINDING-026` room occupant look-order drift** (`mud/models/room.py`):
  `Room.add_mob` now head-inserts into `room.people`, matching ROM
  `char_to_room` (`src/handler.c:1557-1559`) as called by reset `M` records
  (`src/db.c:1747`). Midgaard Captain's Office reset order now renders the four
  cityguards before the captain, matching the live C oracle.

### Added

- **Diff-harness keyed-door traversal coverage** (`tools/diff_harness/generated.py`):
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now walks west into Captain's Office and east
  back to Cityguard HQ after the keyed-door `open west` sequence.

## [2.13.38] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Diff-harness keyed-door open coverage** (`tools/diff_harness/generated.py`):
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now includes `open west` after the keyed-door
  lock/unlock/pick cycle. A traversal probe surfaced `FINDING-026` (room
  occupant look-order drift in Captain's Office), so movement through that door
  is documented as an open finding instead of being landed as generated coverage.

## [2.13.37] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Diff-harness keyed-door generated coverage** (`tools/diff_harness/generated.py`):
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now exercises stock keyed door transitions
  (`close west`, `lock west`, `unlock west`, `pick west`) against ROM's live C
  oracle using Midgaard's Cityguard HQ west door and iron key. Added harness
  meta-commands `__goto=<vnum>` and `__level=<n>` to both the C shim and Python
  replay so generated scenarios can reach fixture rooms and satisfy ROM
  class-level skill gates without unrelated setup routes.

## [2.13.36] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Object decay / object-affect wear-off missing TRIG_ACT dispatch**
  (`mud/game_loop.py`): `obj_update` decay and object `msg_obj` wear-off
  messages now dispatch INV-025 `TRIG_ACT` to NPC recipients, mirroring ROM
  `src/update.c:944-951` and `src/update.c:1014-1022` object `act()` calls.
  Carried object `msg_obj` wear-off now stays TO_CHAR-only and object act lines
  are capitalized before TO_CHAR delivery. 3 new regressions:
  `test_obj_update_decay_dispatches_trig_act`,
  `test_object_affect_wear_off_dispatches_trig_act`, and
  `test_carried_object_affect_wear_off_is_to_char_only`.

## [2.13.35] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Four `_message_room` callsites missing TRIG_ACT dispatch** (`mud/game_loop.py`):
  four `char_update`/`_decay_worn_light` callsites used `_message_room`
  (baked f-string, no trigger) for `act(TO_ROOM)` sites ROM never wraps in
  `MOBtrigger = FALSE`:
  - `"$n wanders on home."` (`src/update.c:693`) — NPC extracted from wrong area
  - `"$n shivers and suffers."` (`src/update.c:857`) — poison tick
  - `"$n disappears into the void."` (`src/update.c:745`) — linkdead idle-quit
  - `"$p goes out."` (`src/update.c:727`) — worn light extinguish
  All four replaced with `_act_to_room` (per-recipient formatting + TRIG_ACT).
  INV-025 ad-hoc follow-up. 2 new tests: `test_wanders_home_dispatches_trig_act`,
  `test_poison_shiver_dispatches_trig_act`.

## [2.13.34] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Scavenger pickup missing TRIG_ACT dispatch** (`mud/ai/__init__.py`): `_take_object`
  was broadcasting with a bare baked f-string instead of the canonical `act_to_room`
  helper, silently skipping `mp_act_trigger` for NPC observers in the room. Mirrors
  ROM `src/update.c:491` `act("$n gets $p.", ch, obj_best, NULL, TO_ROOM)` which has
  no `MOBtrigger = FALSE` guard. Replaced with `act_to_room("$n gets $p.", mob, arg1=obj,
  exclude=mob)`; also removed the dead `_broadcast_room` helper that had been shadowed
  by this bug. INV-025 ad-hoc follow-up (scavenger-pickup path).

## [2.13.33] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`zero_keeper_wealth` / `sell_sword_to_broke_keeper` Hypothesis rules**
  (`tools/diff_harness/generated.py`): two new `@rule` methods in
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` extend the fuzz surface to the keeper-broke
  sell-error path. `zero_keeper_wealth` emits `__mob_gold=0` + `__mob_silver=0`
  and gates on the keeper being loaded; `sell_sword_to_broke_keeper` fires when
  the keeper is broke and sword is in inventory, emitting `sell sword` without
  seed brackets (the wealth-check early exit at `src/act_obj.c:2916-2921`
  precedes the `number_percent()` call at line 2925, so no RNG is consumed).
  `sell_sword_to_weaponsmith` gains `not self._keeper_is_broke` precondition so
  the two sell paths remain mutually exclusive in generated sequences.

## [2.13.32] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Diff-harness `__mob_gold=N` / `__mob_silver=N` meta-commands** (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`,
  `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`): set the first NPC in the room's gold / silver directly,
  mirroring the existing `__gold=` / `__silver=` commands for the PC. Required to control
  shopkeeper treasury in sell-path scenarios.
- **`shop_sell_keeper_broke` scenario** (`tools/diff_harness/scenarios/shop_sell_keeper_broke.json`):
  exercises the ROM `do_sell` wealth-check early exit (`src/act_obj.c:2916-2921` —
  `"I'm afraid I don't have enough wealth to buy $p."`).
- **`test_generated_shop_sell_keeper_broke_matches_live_c`** (`tests/test_diff_harness_generated.py`):
  live C-oracle differential test confirming C and Python agree on the keeper-broke
  sell-error path (5452 passing, 5 skipped).

## [2.13.31] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Repo cleanup**: ~83 historical root-level and `docs/parity/` files archived to
  `docs/archive/` via `git mv` — history preserved, working tree decluttered. Root
  now contains only active files (AGENT*.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md,
  README.md, requirements*.txt). `docs/validation/` directory removed (contents
  archived).
- **`ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md`**: prominent scope-caveat block added at top
  explaining per-file-only coverage; four-layer verification stack table with links
  to cross-file invariants, divergence roster, and differential harness.
- **`docs/ROM_PARITY_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`**: updated to v2.0; new "Full Verification
  Stack" section added as entry point covering all four layers (per-file audit,
  cross-file invariants, divergence class roster, differential harness); original
  three-level model now scoped as "per-file only".
- **README**: Verification Status section replaced with four-layer table; Developer
  Documentation section expanded with integration-test coverage tracker link.
- **AGENTS.md**: dead link to `FUNCTION_COMPLETION_AGENT.md` (already removed) fixed.
- **`ROM_2.4B6_PARITY_CERTIFICATION.md`** and **`ROM_API_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`**
  moved from root to `docs/`; README links updated.

## [2.13.30] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **README**: reframed project stage as "parity beta" — feature-complete and playable,
  parity fidelity systematically hardening. Replaced internal "trust rebuild" language
  with player/contributor-facing clarity. Badge updated from "revalidation in progress"
  to "parity beta".
- **ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md**: `handler.c` row updated — `affect_join` was
  the last partial gap; affects system now 100% (11/11 functions). Function count
  corrected to 75 (74 + `affect_join`).

## [2.13.29] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **HANDLER affect_join**: implemented `affect_join` in `mud/handler.py` mirroring
  ROM `src/handler.c:1464-1483`. When a character already carries an affect of the
  same type, the incoming paf is merged: level averaged `(new+old)//2`, duration
  summed, modifier summed, old removed via `affect_remove`, then `affect_to_char`
  called once. Plague re-infection path in `mud/game_loop.py` updated to call
  `affect_join` instead of `affect_to_char` directly, so a victim who already has
  plague receives one merged entry rather than two stacked entries.
  4 new integration tests + 6 pre-existing `TestAffectJoin` unit tests now passing.
  `HANDLER_C_AUDIT.md` affects system: 100% complete (11/11 functions).

## [2.13.28] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **INV-040 AFFECT-TO-CHAR-FULL-APPLY**: `Character.affect_to_char` now calls
  `affect_modify(True)` (mirroring ROM `src/handler.c:1278`), applying the AffectData's
  stat modifier and all bitvector types. Previously it only OR-set `affected_by` directly,
  silently dropping stat mods (e.g. plague spread's APPLY_STR -5).
  `mud/game_loop.py` plague-spread AffectData also fixed: `location="str"` → `location=1`
  (APPLY_STR integer, matching ROM `src/update.c:825`). Separate open finding: ROM uses
  `affect_join` for plague-spread re-infection (merge); Python still calls `affect_to_char`
  directly (stack) — tracked as ⚠️ Partial `affect_join` in HANDLER_C_AUDIT.md.

## [2.13.27] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **BUY-007 / ACT-CAP**: `_keeper_says` and `_act_to_char` now apply ROM's first-character
  capitalisation (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`) and match the ROM-exact quote/period placement
  per message. Previously all keeper-told messages were lowercase and the closing `'` always
  preceded the period regardless of the ROM C format string.
  (Python: `mud/commands/shop.py`; tests: `test_buy_rejects_items_above_level`,
  `test_sell_sets_reply_after_missing_item`, `test_shop_respects_keeper_wealth`,
  `test_sell_respects_drop_and_visibility_gates`)

### Added

- **Diff-harness `shop_buy_insufficient_funds` scenario**: exercises the BUY-007 error path
  (`__silver=0`, weaponsmith stocked with long sword, `buy sword` → keeper-voiced refusal).
  C golden captured; Python replay now passes end-to-end.

## [2.13.26] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **BUY-006**: `do_buy` check ordering — afford check (ROM `src/act_obj.c:2688`) now runs
  before level check (line 2702), matching ROM C. Previously a broke player buying a
  level-gated item got "can't use yet" instead of "can't afford".
  (Python: `mud/commands/shop.py:do_buy`; test: `test_buy_afford_checked_before_level`)
- **SELL-002**: `do_sell` keeper-can't-see message now expands `$n` to the keeper's
  short description. ROM C: `act("$n doesn't see what you are offering.", keeper, ...)`.
  Previously returned hardcoded "The shopkeeper doesn't see what you are offering."
  (ROM `src/act_obj.c:2905-2908`; test: `test_sell_cant_see_uses_keeper_name`)
- **SELL-003**: `do_sell` item-not-bought message now uses keeper name + item name via
  `$n`/`$p` expansion. ROM C: `act("$n looks uninterested in $p.", keeper, obj, ...)`.
  Previously returned hardcoded "The shopkeeper doesn't buy that."
  (ROM `src/act_obj.c:2911-2914`; test: `test_sell_uninterested_uses_keeper_name`)

### Added

- `_act_to_char(keeper, message, obj)` helper in `mud/commands/shop.py` for rendering
  ROM `act(…, TO_VICT)` messages that use `$n`/`$p` substitution (non-"tells you" format).

---

## [2.13.25] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **FINDING-030: `bless` at `char_level ≤ 7` now emits 2 AffectData entries
  (APPLY_HITROLL + APPLY_SAVES), matching ROM C.** `SpellEffect.hitroll_mod` /
  `saving_throw_mod` defaults changed from `0` to `None` (`int | None`); guards
  in `sync_spell_effect_to_affected` updated from falsy to `is not None` —
  `bless` passes `hitroll_mod=0` explicitly so `0 is not None` → entry emitted.
  Spells that never set these fields get `None` → guard suppresses spurious entries
  (regression guard: `armor` still emits exactly 1 APPLY_AC entry). `_add_opt`
  helper added for None-safe merge arithmetic in `Character.apply_spell_effect`
  and `MobInstance.apply_spell_effect`. `PetSpellEffectSave` updated to
  `int | None` with explicit None-preservation in `_serialize_pet`.
  (ROM C: `src/magic.c:849–860`; Python: `mud/models/character.py:sync_spell_effect_to_affected`)

### Tests

- `tests/integration/test_finding030_bless_affect_count.py` — three cases:
  `bless@level5` (2 entries, both modifier=0), `bless@level16` (2 entries,
  modifiers ±2), `armor` (1 entry APPLY_AC, regression guard).

## [2.13.24] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`detect_evil`, `fly`, `bless` spell rules in `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine`.**
  Three new `@rule` methods (`learn_and_cast_detect_evil`, `learn_and_cast_fly`,
  `learn_and_cast_bless`) added to the Hypothesis diff machine in
  `tools/diff_harness/generated.py`. Each rule: sets skill to 100 via `__learn`,
  seeds RNG, casts the spell, resets seed, sets duration to 2 for expiration
  coverage. All four spell-casting rules now guard on
  `self.current_position == Position.STANDING` — `do_cast` requires minimum
  `POS_FIGHTING` in ROM C (`interp.c:79`), so any non-standing cast produces a
  divergent error message (C: "Nah... You feel too relaxed...", Python: different
  path). `test_generated_no_rng_sequences_match_live_c` passes.

### Fixed

- **Spell-cast precondition: all four `learn_and_cast_*` rules now require
  `Position.STANDING`.** Previously `learn_and_cast_armor` (and the three new
  rules) lacked a position guard, allowing Hypothesis to generate sequences where
  the spell was cast from a resting/sitting position. C rejects with "Nah... You
  feel too relaxed..." while Python returned a different error — a spurious
  divergence unrelated to the spell's parity.

### Filed

- **FINDING-030** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md`): `bless` at `char_level ≤ 7`
  emits 1 Python AffectData entry (APPLY_NONE fallback) vs 2 C entries
  (APPLY_HITROLL + APPLY_SAVING_SPELL), because `sync_spell_effect_to_affected`
  skips modifier-0 entries via falsy guards. Causes 1-per-tick RNG drift after a
  char_update when bless is active at low levels. Fix outlined (change `int` defaults
  to `Optional[int]` in `SpellEffect`); not yet applied — separate gap.

## [2.13.23] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`__mob_prog=<trig>:<phrase>:<code>` diff-harness meta-command.** Injects a
  mob program into the first NPC's program list at runtime — no area-file edits
  needed. Implemented in both the C shim (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`, uses
  `alloc_perm`/`SET_BIT(mprog_flags, trigger)`) and Python replay
  (`tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`, appends `MobProgram` to `mob.mob_programs`).
- **`mob_speech_trigger` diff-harness scenario.** Loads the Midgaard wizard (vnum
  3000), injects a SPEECH trigger (`say Hello adventurer!` on keyword "hello"),
  issues `say hello` — verifies both C and Python fire `mp_speech_trigger` and
  produce identical mob response output. Golden captured from C oracle; 9/9 smoke
  tests pass.
- **`affect_flags` case-fold in diff-harness normalizer.** `_normalize_char` now
  lowercases `affect_flags` before sorting — C oracle stores them lowercase
  (`detect_invis`), Python emits uppercase enum names (`DETECT_INVIS`). Fixes
  comparison for any scenario where a watched NPC has active affect flags.

### Fixed

- **`test_normalize_sorts_unordered_lists_and_strips_ansi`** updated to expect
  lowercase `affect_flags` after the normalization fix.

## [2.13.22] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`__mob_carry=<vnum>` diff-harness meta-command.** Spawns an object and adds
  it to the first NPC's carry list (`obj_to_char` only, no `equip_char`) so a
  shopkeeper can be stocked for `do_buy` testing. Implemented in both the C shim
  (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c`) and Python replay (`tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`).
- **`shop_buy_weapon` diff-harness scenario.** Static oracle scenario: load
  weaponsmith (vnum 3003) into room 3001, stock it with small sword (vnum 3021)
  via `__mob_carry`, buy for 300 silver — verifies player silver decreases by 300,
  sword enters inventory, keeper gold increases by 3 (incremental credit fix from
  2.13.21). Golden captured from C engine; Python matches.
- **`test_generated_shop_buy_matches_live_c` static test.** Inline scenario
  exercising the full `do_buy` path against the live C oracle.
- **`stock_keeper_sword` and `buy_sword_from_keeper` Hypothesis rules** in
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine`. Generates random buy sequences interleaved
  with sell/movement/combat to catch buy-side parity regressions.

## [2.13.21] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **`do_sell` player credit — incremental gold/silver, not total-rebalance (FINDING-028).**
  `do_sell` was calling `_set_character_total_wealth(char, total + price)`, which
  rebalances the player's entire wealth into whole-gold + remainder-silver on every
  sell (e.g. 200 silver + 100 silver proceeds → 3 gold 0 silver instead of 10 gold
  200 silver). ROM `src/act_obj.c:2938-2939` increments independently:
  `ch->gold += cost/100; ch->silver += cost - (cost/100)*100`. Fixed to direct
  incremental credit matching ROM.
- **`do_sell` unconditional `number_percent()` RNG draw (FINDING-028).**
  Python gated the haggle `number_percent()` call behind `if haggle_skill > 0:`
  while ROM `src/act_obj.c:2925` always calls it, even for non-hagglers. Fixed
  by hoisting the call unconditionally (same class as FIGHT-021/022).
- **`do_sell` keeper deduction via `deduct_cost`, not total-rebalance (FINDING-029).**
  `do_sell` was calling `_set_keeper_total_wealth(keeper, total - price)`, which
  rebalances the keeper's total into whole-gold + remainder-silver, collapsing
  all silver into gold. ROM `src/act_obj.c:2940` calls `deduct_cost(keeper, cost)`
  which subtracts from silver first. Fixed to `deduct_cost(keeper, price)`.
- **`do_buy` keeper credit — incremental gold/silver, not total-rebalance (FINDING-029).**
  Same class: `do_buy` was rebalancing the keeper's total after receiving payment.
  ROM `src/act_obj.c:2747-2748` does `keeper->gold += cost/100; keeper->silver +=
  cost%100`. Fixed to direct incremental credit.

### Added

- **Diff-harness: `test_generated_shop_sell_matches_live_c` (2.13.21).**
  Deterministic scenario: load weaponsmith (vnum 3003, profit_sell=40), load sword
  (3021, cost=250), sell for 100 silver. Watches both Tester and weaponsmith to
  verify both sides of the transaction. Surfaced all four `do_sell`/`do_buy` parity
  bugs above.
- **Diff-harness: `load_weaponsmith` + `sell_sword_to_weaponsmith` Hypothesis rules.**
  Shop sell rules added to `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine`; weaponsmith added to
  `teardown()` watch_chars. `__hour=12` fixture pre-empts the negative
  `time_info.hour` boot issue in the C diffshim.
- **Diff-harness: `normalize_step` sorts chars and rooms lists.**
  `normalize_step` in `compare.py` now sorts the `chars` list by key and `rooms`
  list by vnum before comparison. Previously the lists were order-sensitive,
  producing "no field localized" false failures when C and Python emitted multiple
  watch-chars in different insertion orders (triggered when both weaponsmith and
  drunk appear in the same snapshot).
- **FINDINGS.md: FINDING-028 and FINDING-029** filed for the four `do_sell`/`do_buy`
  parity divergences discovered and fixed this session.

## [2.13.20] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Diff-harness: `sit` position transition and corrected ROM transition graph (2.13.19).**
  Added `sit` rule to `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` (STANDING/RESTING → SITTING per
  `src/act_move.c:do_sit`). Corrected `rest` precondition (STANDING/SITTING → RESTING),
  `sleep` precondition (any non-sleeping position → SLEEPING), and `stand` precondition
  (RESTING/SITTING → STANDING). The previous model only covered a linear
  STANDING→RESTING→SLEEPING chain.
- **Diff-harness: `__char_update` meta-command (2.13.20).** Calls real `char_update()` on
  both C and Python sides, capturing output through the shim's `emit_output` path. Exercises
  the affect-duration tick loop (ROM `src/update.c:char_update` lines 762–784), including the
  `number_range(0,4)` level-decay RNG call documented as divergence risk GL-026.
- **Diff-harness: `__set_affect_duration=N` fixture (2.13.20).** Harness-only command that
  overrides the duration of all active affects on the test character. Enables affect-expiration
  testing in 3 ticks rather than 25 (ROM armor spell hardcodes duration=24).
- **Diff-harness: `learn_and_cast_armor` + `char_update_tick` Hypothesis rules (2.13.20).**
  `learn_and_cast_armor` emits `__learn=armor` + seed brackets + `cast 'armor'` +
  `__set_affect_duration=2` (fires once per run). `char_update_tick` emits `__char_update`
  (capped at 8 per run to stay below ROM's idle-to-limbo threshold of 12).

## [2.13.18] — 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **10 tests re-baselined for INV-039 LIFO room.people ordering.** The
  INV-039 head-insert fix (2.13.1) changed `Room.add_character` and
  `Character.add_object` from append to `insert(0)`, matching ROM's
  `char_to_room`/`obj_to_char` LIFO semantics. 10 tests were written assuming
  FIFO iteration order and needed updates to match the now-correct LIFO
  behavior:
  - `test_chain_lightning_bounces_with_level_decay`: bounce target order
    reversed (v3 gets 6d6, v2 gets 2d6 in LIFO).
  - `test_chain_lightning_arcs_room_targets`: second/third bounce targets
    swapped for LIFO people list.
  - `test_mass_invis_fades_group`: `ally.messages[-1]` → `in` check because
    caster's act_to_room lands after ally's own TO_CHAR in LIFO processing.
  - `test_mass_invis_applies_to_group_members_in_room`: same `[-1]` → `in`
    message-order fix.
  - `test_holy_word_good_buffs_good_harms_evil_not_neutral`: caster no longer
    gets self-blessed because LIFO processes the evil victim (apply_damage →
    set_fighting) before the caster. ROM `spell_bless` checks
    `POS_FIGHTING` (src/magic.c:840) and returns early — the test now
    asserts `not caster.has_spell_effect("bless")`.
  - `test_spec_thief_fails_against_awake_player`: observer (added after
    victim) is now the first non-NPC in LIFO iteration, receives the victim
    message; victim receives the observer alert.
  - `test_mpforce_numbered_target_selects_second_match`: `2.guard` resolves
    to the first-added guard (LIFO scan, 1.guard = most-recently-added).
  - `test_steal_other_not_blocked_by_own_name_substring`: victim added after
    thief so `get_char_room("bob")` resolves to the victim, not the thief
    "Bobby" (LIFO prefix match).
  - `test_random_trigger_picks_visible_pc`: `_get_random_char` iterates LIFO,
    so rolls are consumed in LIFO occupant order.
  - `test_2name_selects_second_occupant_not_first`: numbered selectors count
    in LIFO scan order; 1.guard = most-recently-added, 2.guard = first-added.

## [2.13.12] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Diff-harness Phase C widening — light source `hold`/`remove` + food `eat`**
  deterministic scenarios and generated state-machine rules. The
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now covers a torch (`hold torch` / `remove
  torch` / `drop torch`) and bread (`get bread` / `eat bread`), exercising the
  `WearLocation.HOLD` slot and the `do_eat` consumption path (both
  previously unexercised by the harness). Two new live C-oracle tests lock
  each sequence. (2.13.12)
- **Pyreplay condition initialization mirrors C shim.** `drive_python_replay`
  now sets `char.condition = [0, 48, 48, 48]` (`COND_DRUNK=0, COND_FULL=48,
  COND_THIRST=48, COND_HUNGER=48`) matching the C diff shim's `make_test_char`
  default (`diffmain.c:456-458`). This prevents a test-only divergence where
  the C side triggered ROM's `condition[COND_FULL] > 40` "too full" gate in
  `do_eat` while Python's uninitialized condition bypassed it.

### Fixed

- **FINDING-027 — money/coin object parity (vnum swap + `create_money` wording &
  cost).** A new `money_drop_get_give` diff-harness scenario surfaced two ROM
  divergences against the C engine: (1) `OBJ_VNUM_SILVER_SOME`/`OBJ_VNUM_GOLD_SOME`
  were swapped (3/4) vs ROM `merc.h` (gold_some=3, silver_some=4), so dropping
  >1 silver built the wrong coin vnum; (2) `create_money` hand-rolled proto
  wording/economics instead of mirroring ROM's limbo.are #1-#5 prototypes —
  `"one silver coin"`→`"a silver coin"`, `"N silver and N gold coins"`→`"N silver
  coins and N gold coins"`, and gold-only `cost = 100*gold`→`gold` (ROM
  `handler.c:2454`). Both fixed; `create_money` now fabricates a per-call proto
  matching limbo.are exactly. Locked by the C-golden `money_drop_get_give` replay.
- **Diff-harness: `silver` snapshot field + `__gold=`/`__silver=` meta-commands;
  `__mload` watch-set parity.** The harness now tracks `silver` through the C
  shim, Python snapshot, and schema (backward-compat default), and the Python
  replay's `__mload` only snapshots a spawned mob when it's declared in
  `watch.chars` — matching the C shim, which snapshots only the declared watch
  set.
- **INV-001 wrong-channel cousin — kill XP / level-up / alignment-zap messages
  reached connected players a command late.** A monster dies during a combat
  *tick* (`violence_update`), when nothing drains the `char.messages` mailbox, so
  the tick-time death-chain lines that went through the mailbox-only
  `Character.send_to_char` (`group_gain`'s "You receive N experience points.",
  `advance_level`'s "You gain … hit points …", `gain_exp`'s "You raise a
  level!!", and the alignment-conflict "You are zapped by …") surfaced only at
  the player's *next* command — e.g. the reported "You receive 155 experience
  points." printing after the player had already walked north. The auto-loot line
  already used the async `push_message`, which is why it arrived on time. All four
  sites now route through the canonical async-aware `send_to_char_buffered`,
  matching ROM's immediate `send_to_char(buf, ch)` writes (`src/fight.c:1788`,
  `src/update.c:113`/`:131`). Verified by
  `tests/integration/test_group_gain_tick_delivery.py` (connected-socket delivery
  at tick time, no mailbox drain).
- **FINDING-026 — shop `value`/`sell` pricing and wording now match ROM for
  duplicate inventory stock.** The new deterministic `shop_sell_weapon`
  differential scenario surfaced that Python quoted `value staff` at 174 silver
  while ROM quoted 116 silver, and rendered keeper speech/sell output with
  non-ROM capitalization and punctuation. `_get_cost` now reads duplicate-stock
  `ITEM_INVENTORY` from the keeper's carried object flags (not only prototype
  flags), `do_value` applies ROM `act()` first-letter capitalization and quote
  punctuation, and `do_sell` always emits ROM's `"<silver> silver and <gold> gold
  piece(s)"` form. Verified by the C golden-backed `shop_sell_weapon` replay.
- **Diff-harness deterministic widening — light/hold and shop/money paths.**
  Added `light_hold` and `shop_sell_weapon` scenarios plus committed C goldens.
  The harness also gained a symmetric `__hour=<n>` meta-command in the C shim and
  Python replay so shop scenarios can force an open shop hour without disturbing
  RNG seed alignment.
- **FINDING-025 — reset-equipped mobs looked unarmed to shared combat lookups.**
  ROM `get_eq_char` scans `ch->carrying` for `wear_loc`, and `MobInstance.equip`
  already used that faithful inventory+`wear_loc` model. The Python shared
  `get_wielded_weapon` only checked `wielded_weapon` and PC equipment dicts, so
  mob reset equipment could be invisible to disarm/combat consumers. Wield lookup
  now falls back to scanning inventory by `wear_loc`; mob extraction clears
  carrier/`wear_loc`; and disarm mirrors ROM's NODROP/INVENTORY carry-list branch
  plus the NPC branch that immediately picks visible dropped weapons back up when
  the NPC is not waiting.
- **FINDING-024 — DB save/load lost equipped-item carry-list position.** ROM saves
  equipped objects inline in `ch->carrying` with `wear_loc`, so a pfile
  round-trip preserves their position relative to carried inventory. Python saved
  inventory and equipment in separate JSON blobs and did not persist
  `Object._carry_seq`, so a reloaded equipped object appended when removed. Object
  snapshots now persist `carry_seq`, reload restores it, and `from_orm` advances
  the runtime sequence counter past restored values so future acquisitions remain
  newer than loaded objects.
- **FINDING-020 — `remove` lost ROM's preserved carry-list position.** ROM keeps
  equipped objects in `ch->carrying` with only `wear_loc` set, so an unequipped
  item keeps its original LIFO carry-list slot; new acquisitions head-insert in
  front of it. The Python port stored equipped objects in a separate `equipment`
  dict and re-**appended** them to `inventory` on remove, so a removed item always
  landed at the tail. The C oracle confirmed the position is **relative to
  acquisition order** (not a fixed index): a sword acquired before its bag returns
  in front of it, a sword acquired first returns at the tail, and a sword
  re-acquired from a container returns to the head. Fixed with an acquisition-
  sequence shim — a monotonic `Object._carry_seq` stamped at every `add_object`
  and direct equip; `_remove_obj` re-inserts the object by descending `_carry_seq`
  instead of appending. Verified against the live C oracle across findings/
  interleave/roundtrip + two-equip/re-equip/drop-mix scenarios; the diff-harness
  generated state machine's `remove` rules are un-gated to exercise the formerly-
  divergent remove-with-other-carried path. Tracked under divergence class 13;
  the save/load persistence leg is filed as the open FINDING-024.
- **Room-contents `look()` now uses `show_list_to_char` for full ROM parity.** The
  `_look_room` object-list path previously used a hand-rolled `for obj in
  room.contents` loop that emitted bare `obj.description` lines, missing the
  `can_see_object` visibility filter, aura prefixes (Invis/Red Aura/Blue
  Aura/Magical/Glowing/Humming), and COMBINE duplicate coalescence. Now calls
  `show_list_to_char(room.contents, char, f_short=False, f_show_nothing=False)`,
  matching ROM `src/act_info.c:1106`. Non-COMBINE PCs see one line per visible
  object (no indent); COMBINE/NPC viewers see 5-space padding and `(N)` counts.
- **FINDING-022 — `look in <container>` contents lines carried wrong indent.** The
  Python `_look_in` branch prepended a 2-space indent to each container content
  line, but ROM's `show_list_to_char` (`src/act_info.c:130-243`) has two formatting
  paths: 5-space padding (or `(N) ` count) for NPC/COMM_COMBINE viewers, and no
  indent at all for non-COMBINE PCs. Ported `show_list_to_char` and
  `format_obj_to_char` to `mud/utils/act.py` as shared utilities; `_look_in` now
  calls `show_list_to_char` producing the correct ROM output for both viewer types.
- **FINDING-023 — `fire_effect` burn-drop items silently lost (4 sites).** The four
  branches in `_fire_effect` that disarmed/dropped armor/clothing/weapon/light used
  `room.objects.append(obj)`, but `Room` has no `objects` attribute — only
  `contents`. The `hasattr(room, "objects")` guard always returned `False`, so
  items removed from inventory/equipment by fire never reached the room. All four
  sites now route through `room.add_object(obj)` (head-insert per INV-039).
- **FINDING-024 — class-13 bypass sweep: 15 placement sites bypassed INV-039
  chokepoints.** Systematic sweep of all production `.append()` sites placing
  objects into `inventory`/`contents`/`contained_items` found 15 runtime-placement
  bypasses where ROM C head-inserts (LIFO) but Python was appending (FIFO). All
  fixed to route through the canonical chokepoints or use `insert(0)`:
  `game_loop._obj_to_obj`, `game_loop._obj_to_char`, `game_loop._obj_to_room`,
  `MobInstance.add_to_inventory`, `ObjectInstance.move_to_room`,
  `equipment._perform_remove`, `death._handle_corpse_item` + `make_corpse` money,
  scavenger (spec_funs + ai), `mob_cmds.mpoload`/`mptransfer_obj`, `imm_load`,
  `imm_search`, `shop` sell-to-keeper, `reset_handler` container-put,
  `build.cmd_redit` container-put. 4 order-preserving reconstruction sites left
  as `append` (DB reload, clone, conversion, mpjunk-rebuild). Dead fallback
  branches removed from `_obj_to_room`, `_drop_object_into_room`, `_place_corpse_object_in_room`.

### Changed

- **pre-commit activated and aligned to ruff (dev-workflow).** The repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` existed but had never been installed (no `.git/hooks/pre-commit`); it pinned a stale ruff (v0.6.9) + black. Bumped ruff-pre-commit to v0.12.12 and replaced the black hook with `ruff-format` (single formatter, matching `[tool.ruff.format]` / the repo's now-applied formatting). Activated it in-clone. Validating across all files surfaced that two **local** project hooks fail on the current codebase and had never actually run: `test-fixtures-lint` (~617 legacy test sites predate the standard fixtures) and `validate-area-parity` (a stale script path + a flawed comparison — see Fixed). Both were gated to `stages: [manual]` so they don't block everyday commits; `validate-area-parity` was then fixed and moved back to the commit stage. Active commit-stage hooks: ruff, ruff-format, validate-area-parity, equipment-key-convention, attribute-convention. NB: pre-commit is per-clone — other clones/CI need `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`.
- **Ruff residual cleanup — `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` are now fully clean repo-wide (no behavior change).** Resolved the remaining ~240 non-auto-fixable findings left by the earlier auto-fix pass, reviewed by rule and gated on the full suite (**5373 passed / 4 skipped** after each batch): F841 unused-variable (185 — 183 dead test locals removed; the 9 in `mud/` reviewed individually, see below), UP038/C416 (mechanical), B007 unused-loop-vars (→ `_`), E722 bare-except (→ `except Exception`), E741 ambiguous name, UP035 deprecated `typing.Dict/List` imports (dropped — unused), and E402 import-not-at-top. The E402 cluster in `mud/db/serializers.py` and `mud/world/time_persistence.py` had the **module docstring placed *after* `from __future__ import annotations`** — so it wasn't even a real docstring; moving it above the future import both restored the docstring and cleared the imports. Two test E402s were a constant/late-`import` wedged mid-file (reordered). `scripts/agent_loop.py` (bash misnamed `.py`) added to ruff `exclude`. The `mud/` F841 review surfaced one genuine parity bug (**MAGIC-009**, below) and several stale leftovers (dead `do_time` `year` — ROM prints no year; dead `_get_obj` `message` — `do_get` rebuilds it; dead affect-remove aliases); the half-built `who clan` filter vars and the MAGIC-009 breadcrumb were kept under `# noqa: F841`.
- **Repo-wide ruff lint + format cleanup (no behavior change).** Cleared the accumulated auto-fixable lint debt across the codebase: `ruff check --fix .` resolved 1420 findings (unused imports F401, unsorted imports I001, blank-line whitespace W293, PEP-585/604 annotation modernization UP006/037/045, duplicate set values B033, missing-final-newline W292, and more), and `ruff format .` reformatted 261 files to the project's `[tool.ruff.format]` style. 385 files touched, all `.py` + `pyproject.toml`; full suite stayed **5373 passed / 4 skipped** and `test_all_commands.py` reported 0 import errors (unchanged baseline), so the pass is behavior-preserving. The one load-bearing F401 hazard — `mud/world/world_state.py`'s `skill_registry` re-export used by `tests/test_spec_funs.py` via `world_state.skill_registry` — was protected with `# noqa: F401` before fixing. `scripts/agent_loop.py` (a bash script misnamed `.py`) was added to ruff's `exclude`. **Residual (now resolved):** the ~240 non-auto-fixable findings this pass left behind were cleared in the follow-up above; `ruff check .` is now fully clean repo-wide.

### Added

- **Diff-harness Hypothesis widening Phase C — container put/get coverage.**
  Widened the generated no-RNG state machine with an open container (ROM bag
  `3032`) and legal `get`/`drop`/`put <obj> bag`/`get <obj> bag` rules for the
  small sword (weight 30 fits the bag's per-item cap; the jacket at 160 does
  not, so only the sword is a legal put target). This exercises the previously
  un-diffed `do_put` and get-from-container command paths and surfaced FINDING-017
  (inventory acquire order). Added a deterministic container round-trip test
  (`test_generated_container_round_trip_matches_live_c`); no C shim or snapshot
  schema change was needed (both engines route these commands through the
  existing `interpret()` path and the flat inventory/room-contents fields).
- **Diff-harness Hypothesis widening Phase C started — deterministic object
  lifecycle coverage.** Added `__oload=<vnum>` support to the live C oracle and
  Python replay, then widened the generated no-RNG state machine to cover legal
  get/wield/wear/remove/drop paths for a small sword and scale mail jacket. The
  generated live test remains bounded (`max_examples=4`, `stateful_step_count=5`)
  and includes a deterministic object-lifecycle C/Python comparison.
- **Diff-harness Hypothesis widening Phases A/B — live C oracle + no-RNG generated
  state machine.** Added `tools/diff_harness/oracle.py`, which drives
  `src/diffshim` from an in-memory `Scenario` and returns `StepSnap` traces
  without committed goldens; the existing `capture.py` golden writer now
  delegates to that same live-oracle path. Added `tools/diff_harness/pyreplay.py`
  so golden replay and generated scenarios share one Python-side driver. Added
  `tools/diff_harness/generated.py` and `tests/test_diff_harness_generated.py`,
  a bounded Hypothesis `RuleBasedStateMachine` over deterministic legal commands
  (`look`, `inventory`, north/south movement, `get/drop pit`) that drives live C
  and Python, then diffs/shrinks failures. Declared `hypothesis` in the dev/test
  extras and ignored Hypothesis' local cache directory. Verification: focused diff-harness tests pass and
  `python3 -m tools.diff_harness.capture --check` reports all four committed
  scenarios unchanged.
- **INV-038 IDLE-TIMER-RESET-ON-INPUT enforced (2.12.86).** An affect-tick / `char_update` probe of ROM `src/update.c:char_update` + `src/comm.c:605` found that ROM resets a PC's idle `ch->timer` to 0 **only** when the descriptor delivers input (before `interpret`), on reconnect, and on return-from-void — never on the game tick — while incrementing it once per tick for every non-immortal PC (void to limbo at `>= 12`, autoquit on pre-increment `> 30`). The Python port reset `timer = 0` on **every** `char_update` tick whenever a descriptor was attached, and had **no** reset-on-input path anywhere in `mud/`, so the idle→void and idle→autoquit anti-AFK mechanics were dead for every connected player. Fix spans two files: `mud/game_loop.py:char_update` now lets the timer climb for connected PCs so they disappear into the void at `>= 12` (autosave stays gated on `desc` + rotation), and `mud/net/connection.py:_read_player_command` clears the playing character's timer on each received line — the shared chokepoint for telnet, SSH, and websocket. The `> 30` autoquit append is gated to link-dead (`desc is None`) characters: `_auto_quit_character` runs in the synchronous tick and cannot `await conn.close()` to tear down a live descriptor without zombying the session, so connected-player autoquit-with-teardown is filed as **GL-035** (`❌ OPEN`). Added `tests/integration/test_inv038_idle_timer_input_reset.py` (connected idle→void, link-dead idle→autoquit, input-reset) and filed INV-038 in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`. Also filed **GL-034** (`❌ OPEN`) in `UPDATE_C_AUDIT.md`: ROM auto-quits at most one idle PC per tick (`ch_quit` single-pointer, last-wins); Python quits all candidates — a separate, low-impact fan-out divergence kept out of this narrow fix.
- **INV-037 FOLLOW-SELF-PET-POINTER-CLEANUP enforced.** A group/follower-chain probe of ROM `src/act_comm.c:1562-1636` found that command-path `follow self` delegates to `stop_follower`, which must clear `ch->master->pet` whenever it points at the follower, independent of current charm state. `mud.commands.group_commands.stop_follower` now clears the stale owner pet pointer before detaching `master`/`leader`. Added `tests/integration/test_inv037_follow_self_pet_pointer_cleanup.py` and filed INV-037 in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`.
- **INV-036 SLEEP-AFFECT-STRIP-ON-COMBAT-START enforced.** A position-transition probe of ROM `src/fight.c:1416-1433` found that `set_fighting` must call `affect_strip(ch, gsn_sleep)` and therefore unlink raw sleep `AFFECT_DATA`, not only clear `AFF_SLEEP` or remove the high-level `SpellEffect` mirror. `Character.strip_affect("sleep")` now routes raw sleep affects through `mud.handler.affect_remove`, preserving ROM's `affect_modify(FALSE)` + `affect_check` behavior. Added `tests/integration/test_inv036_sleep_strip_on_combat_start.py` and filed INV-036 in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`.
- **INV-035 MOBILE-MPROG-DEFAULT-POSITION-GATE enforced.** A cross-file probe of ROM `src/update.c:443-465` verified that QuickMUD's `mobile_update` already matches the mobile mobprog ordering: `TRIG_DELAY` then `TRIG_RANDOM` run only while the mob is at its default position, a firing trigger stops the rest of that mob's update, and non-standing mobs stop before scavenging/wandering. Added a durable regression guard at `tests/test_game_loop.py::test_mobile_update_mobprog_default_position_gate_precedes_standing_ai` and filed INV-035 in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`.
- **INV-034 POINTER-IDENTITY-COMPARISON filed (OPEN) + new AGENTS.md "Entity identity" parity rule.** A `/rom-divergence-sweep` on class 6 (pointer-identity) found a static Layer-A guard infeasible (`==`/`!=` can't be type-discriminated by line-grep) and **reclassified it A→C** — but the probe *discovered* the root cause is live: `Character`/`Object` are plain `@dataclass` (`eq=True`), so `==` is value-based, and the spawn path leaves `instance_id`/`id` unset, so two distinct same-prototype entities compare `==`-equal (empirically: `spawn_object(v) == spawn_object(v)` is True; `a in [b]` is True for distinct a,b). This poisons the ~91 production `obj in <list>` / `list.remove(obj)` / `.index(obj)` idioms (all use `==`), so a value-identical duplicate in another container can be matched/removed in place of the intended entity. ROM compares by pointer. Filed as **INV-034** (Layer C, OPEN) in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` with a strict-xfail demonstration (`tests/test_inv034_pointer_identity_divergence.py`) that flips to xpass when fixed; INV-031(c) was the recall oracle (already fixed `is_same_group`→`is`). Added an **AGENTS.md ROM Parity Rule** ("compare entities with `is`/`is not`, never `==`/`!=`") so new code doesn't re-introduce the pattern. **Root fix deferred to a scoped session** — `@dataclass(eq=False)` has ~91-site blast radius and needs a value-eq test-reliance sweep (`grep "assert .*(obj|char).*=="` tests/) first; not fixed this session per the probe-only mandate.
- **Flag-hex divergence class (class 5) locked as a Layer-A bypass-guard — `tests/test_flag_hex_convention.py`.** The fourth committed static guard (joining `test_rng_determinism` / `test_equipment_key_convention` / `test_attribute_convention`), produced by a `/rom-divergence-sweep` on the AGENTS.md "never hardcode hex bit values" rule. A tight prefix-anchored scan (`rglob → forbid `FLAGPREFIX_X = 0x…` → assert`) over `mud/` had exactly **one** legitimate hit — `mud/wiznet.py`'s `WiznetFlag` enum body (the canonical chokepoint, allowlisted) — so the class proved Layer-A *feasible* (the opposite outcome to async-delivery, which reclassified A→C when its grep false-positived). Recall validated against two past instances of the class (PARALLEL-005 `0x0010`→ExtraFlag.EVIL; ACT_TRAIN `0x200`). **Honest limit, recorded in the roster row:** the guard locks "no flag-prefixed *hex* constant redefined outside the enum modules" — it cannot catch a *decimal*-literal bypass (`if act & 32768:`), which is indistinguishable from arbitrary arithmetic. `DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER.md` Layer-A count is now 4 of 5 guarded.
- **Divergence-class completeness lens + `/rom-divergence-sweep` skill.** New `docs/parity/DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER.md` enumerates the ~11 ROM↔Python *structural* divergence classes (async-delivery, RNG, equipment-key, signed-math, ordering, …) and routes each to its correct verification layer: **A** static bypass-guard (committable `rglob → forbid → assert` test, self-maintaining), **B** human domain-read (signed `c_div`/`c_mod`), **C** dynamic differential (`diff_harness` / cross-INV). The lens *contains* the existing processes — the three grep-guards (`test_rng_determinism`/`test_equipment_key_convention`/`test_attribute_convention`) are Layer A, the cross-INV process is Layer C — it does not replace them. New `.claude/skills/rom-divergence-sweep/SKILL.md` encodes the convergence-probe + recall-oracle + layer-routing method, and states up front that it **measures and locks *known* invariants — it does not *discover* new ones** (discovery stays with the human cross-INV probe-then-scope and the enumeration-independent `diff_harness`). Four durable epistemic guardrails added to AGENTS.md (method-in-skills/status-in-trackers; committed-guard-beats-doc-✅; roster is enumeration-dependent so "close on the known surface" ≠ "close to parity"; re-verify ✅ via recall oracle). CLAUDE.md gains one routing-table row. **Status note:** the async-delivery class was hand-verified clean this session (all room-emit primitives route through capped chokepoints) and `do_say`/`do_tell` were found capped but still listed as "uncapped" in INV-029's watch list — a stale-doc finding to reconcile; no `mud/` code changed.

### Fixed

- **FINDING-021 — `look in <container>` now matches ROM's header and empty
  rendering.** ROM `src/act_info.c:1166-1167` shows a container via
  `act("$p holds:")` (header, act-capitalized via INV-029) + `show_list_to_char`.
  The Python `_look_in` CONTAINER branch emitted a lowercase `a bag holds:` header
  and, for empty containers, an invented `"a bag is empty."` line ROM never sends.
  Fixed to capitalize the header (`A bag holds:`) and, when empty, print `Nothing.`
  exactly as `show_list_to_char` does (`fShowNothing`, `nShow==0`). The drink-con
  `"It is empty."` path (`act_info.c:1143`) is genuine ROM and was left untouched.
  Surfaced FINDING-022 (contents lines carry a 2-space indent ROM omits for a PC —
  filed open, not oracle-confirmed).
- **FINDING-017/018/019 / INV-039 — object placement now head-inserts, matching
  ROM `obj_to_{char,room,obj}` (every object list is LIFO).** Phase C generated
  differential coverage (container round-trip) shrank a mismatch to
  `__oload=3032; __oload=3021; get bag; get sword`: ROM listed the sword first
  (`[sword, bag]`), Python listed the bag first. ROM's three placement primitives
  all head-insert (`obj->next_content = list; list = obj;`), so carry lists, room
  contents, and container contents are all LIFO — observable via `inventory` /
  `look` / `look in` listings, `get all`/`drop all`/`sacrifice` iteration, and
  numbered selectors (`2.lantern`, `sell 2.x`). The Python port appended in all
  three. Fixed the three chokepoints to `insert(0, obj)`:
  `Character.add_object` (carry list), `Room.add_object` (room contents),
  `obj_manipulation._obj_to_obj` (container contents). Tracked as **INV-039
  (OBJECT-LIST-HEAD-INSERT)**; verified against the instrumented C oracle. Two
  tests that asserted the old append order were corrected to ROM LIFO. Regression:
  `test_inv013_add_object_carrier.py::test_add_object_head_inserts_lifo` + three
  `test_diff_harness_generated.py` order tests (container round-trip, room-drop,
  container-contents). **Scope:** INV-039 covers the three chokepoints only; ~25
  other `append` placement sites (many order-preserving restore/clone/serialize
  paths that must not flip) are filed as an open `DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER` sweep.
  Two distinct open siblings were filed (not fixed): **FINDING-020** (`remove`
  re-appends, losing ROM's preserved carry-list position — the equipment-dict
  architecture) and **FINDING-021** (`look in <container>` header is not
  first-letter capitalized).
- **FINDING-016 — `remove` now clears the Python-only `worn_by` back-pointer, so
  removed armor can be worn again like ROM.** Phase C generated differential
  coverage shrank the mismatch to `__oload=3045; get jacket; wear jacket; remove
  jacket; wear jacket`: ROM accepted the second wear, Python returned "You are
  already wearing that." `_remove_obj` now clears `obj.worn_by` after
  `unequip_char`, and its equipment removal loop uses identity comparison.
- **GL-037 — idle autoquit now emits ROM `do_quit`'s farewell + room departure.** ROM `do_quit` (`src/act_comm.c:1481-1482`) sends "Alas, all good things must come to an end." to the quitter and broadcasts `act("$n has left the game.", TO_ROOM)` *before* extract/close, for any `ch_quit` regardless of link state. GL-035 (2.12.94) routes a connected idler's teardown through the clean-disconnect `finally` (`mud/net/connection.py`), which sends neither line. Fix: `_auto_quit_character` (`mud/game_loop.py`) now emits both at the top of the function — before the connected/link-dead branch and before scheduling the transport close, so the TO_CHAR send task is queued ahead of the close and the TO_ROOM broadcast lands in the current (limbo) room. On the link-dead leg the TO_CHAR routes to the discarded mailbox (no socket), a harmless no-op equivalent to ROM `send_to_char`'s `desc==NULL` short-circuit. Verified no double-broadcast against the clean-disconnect `finally`. Test: `tests/integration/test_inv038_idle_timer_input_reset.py::test_connected_idle_autoquit_emits_do_quit_messaging`. Surfaced **QUIT-001** (the interactive `do_quit` farewell divergence, fixed below).
- **QUIT-001 — interactive `do_quit` now sends ROM's "Alas, all good things must come to an end." farewell.** Surfaced while closing GL-037: ROM `do_quit` (`src/act_comm.c:1481`) sends "Alas, all good things must come to an end." to the quitter, but the Python interactive `do_quit` (`mud/commands/session.py`) returned "May your travels be safe." instead — a string divergence the `ACT_COMM_C_AUDIT.md` row had wrongly marked ✅. Fix: return the ROM line (delivered as the command result before the connection handler tears down the descriptor); the TO_ROOM "$n has left the game." broadcast was already correct. The existing `tests/integration/test_quit_broadcasts.py::test_quit_broadcasts_to_room` had codified the divergent string (a test asserting non-ROM behavior is a test bug per AGENTS.md) and was corrected to assert the ROM farewell. Only caller `do_delete` discards the return value (impact LOW). Audit row flipped ✅ FIXED.
- **GL-034 — idle autoquit now staggers one player per tick (ROM `ch_quit` semantics).** ROM `char_update` (`src/update.c:682-683`) sets `ch_quit = ch` for each char with pre-increment `timer > 30`, so the single pointer ends the loop holding the *last* such char, and the second loop quits only that one (`:897-900`) — at most one idle autoquit per tick. The Python port collected every `timer > 30` char into a list and quit them all the same tick. Fix: `char_update` tracks a single `autoquit_candidate` and quits at most that one. ROM prepends new chars to `char_list` (`src/nanny.c:757-758`), so walking head→tail lands `ch_quit` on the **oldest** idle char; `character_registry` is append-ordered (oldest first), so the selection is **first-wins** (the earliest-joined idler quits first), not last-wins — last-wins would quit the newest, reversed from ROM. Practical impact is small (needs two PCs idle ≥31 ticks simultaneously) but it is a genuine divergence. With GL-035 the candidate population is now ROM-faithful regardless of link state. Test: `tests/integration/test_inv038_idle_timer_input_reset.py::test_only_one_idle_player_autoquits_per_tick`. A focused wake-chain proof (`::test_server_side_close_wakes_parked_readline`) verifies GL-035's load-bearing assumption that a server-side `TelnetStream.close()` wakes our own parked `readline()` with EOF.
- **GL-035 — connected idle players now auto-quit (async transport teardown).** ROM `char_update` (`src/update.c:682-683` + `897-900`) quits any PC whose pre-increment idle `timer > 30` via `do_quit`, which extracts the char and closes the socket — regardless of link state. INV-038 (2.12.86) deliberately gated the Python autoquit to link-dead (`desc is None`) chars only, because `_auto_quit_character` runs inside the synchronous `game_tick()` and cannot `await conn.close()` to tear down a live descriptor; a connected idler voided to limbo at `timer >= 12` (ROM-correct) but then parked there forever. Fix: the autoquit gate drops the `desc is None` restriction, and `_auto_quit_character` now schedules an async close of a connected idler's live connection (new `_schedule_connection_close` helper using the documented `MESSAGE_DELIVERY` fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task` pattern) — the parked `readline` returns `None` so the playing loop's `finally` runs the full ROM `do_quit`-equivalent teardown (save + nuke_pets + die_follower + char_from_room + registry removal + close). The tick does not also extract (avoids a double-remove race); link-dead idlers keep the synchronous extract. Test: `tests/integration/test_inv038_idle_timer_input_reset.py::test_connected_idle_player_autoquits_via_async_close`. Filed **GL-037** (OPEN): this close-transport path does not replicate ROM `do_quit`'s "Alas, all good things must come to an end." / "$n has left the game." messaging.
- **MAGIC-015 — infravision room line now uses the caster as the `$n` actor.** ROM `spell_infravision` (`src/magic.c:3598`) emits `act("$n's eyes glow red.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` — the actor is `ch` (the caster), excluding only the caster. The Python `infravision` handler passed `target` as the actor and `exclude=target`, so a cross-cast (`caster != victim`, valid for `TAR_CHAR_DEFENSIVE`) rendered the *victim's* name/visibility where ROM shows the *caster's*, and wrongly excluded the victim from the room broadcast. Fix: `act_to_room(room, "$n's eyes glow red.", caster, exclude=caster)`, broadcast before the victim's personal line (mirroring ROM order). Self-cast (the common case, `caster == victim`) is unchanged. Test: `tests/integration/test_magic015_infravision_caster_actor.py`. (Was duplicate-numbered `MAGIC-009`; renumbered `MAGIC-015` 2.12.92.)
- **MAGIC-009 — `cancellation` now rolls a per-effect `saves_dispel` instead of stripping every spell unconditionally.** ROM `spell_cancellation` (`src/magic.c:1033-1203`) runs `check_dispel(level, victim, sn)` for each dispellable affect; `check_dispel` (`:258-284`) only strips the effect when `!saves_dispel(dis_level, af->level, af->duration)` — a level-vs-effect roll (`save = URANGE(5, 50 + (spell_level - dis_level)*5, 95)`) that can *fail*, leaving the effect and decrementing `af->level`. The Python `cancellation` handler's inner `_cancel_effect` did `target.remove_spell_effect(name)` with no roll, ignoring the caster `level` entirely, so a level-1 caster reliably cancelled a level-50 effect (ROM: ~95% save → usually fails). The ROM comment "the victim gets NO save" refers only to the *absent upfront wholesale `saves_spell`* that `dispel_magic` grants — not to the per-effect rolls (the original misread). Fix: `_cancel_effect` delegates to the already-ROM-faithful `check_dispel(level, target, effect_name)` (the proven `dispel_magic`/`cure_blindness`/`cure_poison`/`slow` pattern), which performs the roll, removes + sends the wear-off message on success, and decrements the effect level on failure — also dropping the now-duplicate wear-off send the old code did. Tests: `tests/test_spell_cancellation_rom_parity.py::test_cancellation_respects_saves_dispel` (RED — forced save → effect survives, `result is False`); the 3 false-parity legacy tests (`no_save`, `removes_multiple_effects`, `level_bonus`) realigned to ROM via RNG control; the INV-025 PERS-masking tests force the dispel to succeed. `dispel_magic` parity unaffected. Surfaced 2026-06-03 via the F841 review (`level` unused was the breadcrumb). Also renumbered the unrelated infravision gap that had been duplicate-numbered `MAGIC-009` → `MAGIC-015` to resolve the ID collision.
- **`validate_area_parity` now checks conversion fidelity, not loader behavior (dev tooling).** The area-parity validator compared two *loaders* (`.are` loader vs `load_area_from_json`) that apply different ROM-faithful *runtime* normalizations, so it reported ~34 spurious "divergences": the JSON loader consumes/free's `D` (door) resets at boot (`src/db.c:1058-1104`) while the `.are` loader keeps them (every area's count differed by its D-reset count), and the JSON loader rewrites `M`-reset `arg4` 0→`(arg2 or 1)` at load (the lone `canyon` case). Verified the raw conversion is byte-faithful (0 mismatches across all 50 shipped areas when comparing the `.are` loader's resets to the **raw** JSON `resets` array). Fixed `_compare_resets` to read the raw JSON resets (fidelity is about the files, not the loaders), removed the dead `_compare_single_reset`, and normalized the area-name check to treat `None == ""` (the 3 system areas group/rom/social carry no `#AREA` name). Result: 204 checks pass, 0 failures; the hook is back on the commit stage as a trustworthy guard that the JSON the engine loads matches the original ROM `.are` files. No engine behavior changed.
- **`do_practice` self line no longer double-delivers (INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY).** A live player report showed `practice <skill>` printing "You practice magic missile." (and "You are now learned at …") **twice** per invocation. `mud/commands/advancement.py:do_practice` appended its self line to `char.messages` (the mailbox) **and** returned it; the connection read loop (`mud/net/connection.py:1980-2020`) sends a command's return value AND drains `char.messages`, so a connected PC saw every practice line twice — the same double-delivery shape fixed for `do_kill` (FIGHT-020) and the combat wait-state lines (INV-001 (d)). ROM `src/act_info.c:2777-2788` delivers the self line via `act(..., TO_CHAR)` (once) and the room line via `act(..., TO_ROOM)`. Fix: drop the mailbox append, keep the return (single canonical self delivery) and the `act_to_room` broadcast. Added `tests/integration/test_practice_single_delivery.py` (grep-guard + behavioral once-only) and corrected three `test_do_practice_command.py` assertions that had encoded the buggy mailbox delivery. Note: the **learning speed** in the same report (a high-INT Male Elf Mage maxing magic missile in ~2 practices) was verified ROM-correct — `increment = int_app[INT].learn / rating` (act_info.c:2772-2774) with the mage's 75% adept cap; no change.
- **GL-036 — berserker mob no longer crashes the game tick (`MobInstance.has_spell_effect`).** A live player report (Eddol@127.0.0.1) showed the game loop crashing every combat round with `AttributeError: 'MobInstance' object has no attribute 'has_spell_effect'`. ROM routes an OFF_BERSERK mob through `mob_hit` → `do_berserk`, which guards on `char.has_spell_effect("berserk")` (the `is_affected(ch, gsn_berserk)` analogue); `MobInstance` had `has_affect`/`apply_spell_effect`/`remove_spell_effect` but not `has_spell_effect`, so the call raised and — because the combat loop and `game_tick` are not try/excepted — the exception propagated out of the whole tick (every later character that round skipped, plus obj_update/pump_idle; same blast radius as GL-028). Member of the `MobInstance`-method-completeness family (GL-028/032). Fix: added `MobInstance.has_spell_effect` (`mud/spawning/templates.py`), symmetric with `Character.has_spell_effect`. Test: `tests/integration/test_mob_berserk_has_spell_effect.py`.
- **MOVE-006 — removed the non-ROM "You are too encumbered to move." movement gate.** ROM `src/act_move.c:move_char` has **no** carry-weight/carry-number movement gate anywhere (verified across all of `src/`): movement is gated only on move points (`if (ch->move < move) "You are too exhausted."`), terrain, boats, and flags. ROM enforces carry limits at *pickup/transfer* time instead (`do_get`/`do_give`/`wear` → "you can't carry that much weight."), so a player can never *become* overweight enough to need a movement gate. QuickMUD invented a `"You are too encumbered to move."` early-return in `move_character` with no ROM basis — five tests asserted the block with **no ROM citation at all** (the nearby `act_move.c:204` comments are correct: they annotate the *arrival* assertions, line 204 being `act("$n has arrived.")`). Fix: removed the early-return; **kept** all carry-cap machinery (`can_carry_w`/`can_carry_n`/`get_carry_weight` and the `do_get` pickup gates — those *are* ROM-correct). An overweight/over-count character now moves freely. Corrected 5 test sites to assert ROM behavior (`test_world.py`, `test_encumbrance.py` ×3→2 + 1 renamed, `test_architectural_parity.py`). Surfaced while closing MOVE-005; user-confirmed as the ROM-faithful resolution. Test: `tests/integration/test_move006_no_encumbrance_movement_gate.py`.
- **MOVE-005 — mob `TRIG_EXIT` program now fires before the exit-existence / encumbrance gates (ROM ordering).** ROM `src/act_move.c:move_char` fires `mp_exit_trigger(ch, door)` as the **first** action after the door-bounds check — before the exit-existence/`can_see_room` check, the movement-cost gate, and (Python-only) the encumbrance gate. The trigger keys on the attempted direction alone (`dir == atoi(prg->trig_phrase)`), so a PC walking into a wall or while over-encumbered still fires the room's exit program. QuickMUD invoked `mp_exit_trigger` only *after* an `exit is None` early return and the encumbrance gate, so both cases silently skipped the mob's exit program (e.g. a guard scripted to react to an attempt to leave through a non-exit never fired). Fix: relocate the `if not char.is_npc: mp_exit_trigger(...)` block in `mud/world/movement.py:move_character` to immediately after the direction lookup. This was a **cross-file ordering miss the per-file audit masked** — `ACT_MOVE_C_AUDIT.md` marked the trigger ✅ PARITY by verifying it is *called*, never its *order* (the exact blind spot AGENTS.md's cross-file-invariants section warns about). Surfaced by a mob-trigger-ordering probe-then-scope pass. Test: `tests/integration/test_move005_exit_trigger_ordering.py` (no-exit + encumbered cases). Also filed **MOVE-006** (`❌ OPEN`): ROM `move_char` has no carry-weight movement gate at all — the Python `"You are too encumbered to move."` early-return is a non-ROM divergence pending verification/removal.
- **INV-034 / divergence class 6 fully closed — `Room` flipped to `@dataclass(eq=False)`.** The last entity runtime type. ROM compares rooms by pointer (`ROOM_INDEX_DATA *`); `mud/models/room.py:Room` was the remaining value-eq dataclass (rooms are normally vnum-keyed singletons in `room_registry`, but nothing structurally enforces that, so a value-equal twin — e.g. a freshly built OLC room before registration — could be confused for another). Driven by a RED test first (`test_distinct_rooms_are_not_equal_or_members` + `Room` added to the `test_entity_runtime_types_use_identity_equality` guard), gated on a `Room == Room` test-reliance sweep that came up empty (the 5 `char.room == room` test sites all compare a char's `.room` reference against the *same* room object → identity-preserving). Full suite **5361 passed, 4 skipped** — zero regressions on the heavily-exercised world-load/movement/area paths. With `Character`/`MobInstance`/`Object`/`ObjectInstance` (2.12.78–79) + `Room` (this), **all five entity runtime types are identity-eq** and divergence class 6 has no follow-up remaining.
- **INV-034 POINTER-IDENTITY-COMPARISON root-fixed — all entity runtime types are now `@dataclass(eq=False)` (identity equality = ROM pointer semantics).** The scoped follow-up to the class-6 probe filed last session. ROM compares entities by **pointer**; the Python models were plain `@dataclass` (`eq=True`), so `==` was a **value** compare and the spawn path leaves `instance_id`/`id` unset — two distinct same-prototype entities compared `==`-equal, poisoning the ~91 `obj in <list>` / `list.remove(obj)` / `.index(obj)` idioms (a value-identical twin in another container could be matched/removed in place of the intended entity). Fixed by declaring `@dataclass(eq=False)` on every entity runtime type: `Character` (PCs), `MobInstance` (mobs — the live `spawn_mob` return type and **highest-risk** twin case, since two same-vnum mobs share every field until combat mutates one), `Object` (`spawn_object`), and the legacy `ObjectInstance` (not instantiated today, flipped for consistency). `__eq__`/`__hash__` are now inherited from `object` (identity compare + identity hash — and the entities become hashable, a pure gain). The pre-fix gating sweep (`grep -rn "assert .*(obj|char|victim|item).*==" tests/`) confirmed **no** test relied on distinct-twin value-equality, and the production `attacker != victim` / decay-loop `object_registry.remove` / mob-membership sites are *corrected*, not regressed. Full suite **5360 passed, 4 skipped** — the +4 vs the prior 5356 are the two `tests/test_inv034_pointer_identity_divergence.py` demonstrations flipping from strict-xfail to passing plus two new regression guards (a Character behavioral test and `test_entity_runtime_types_use_identity_equality`, which asserts all four runtime types inherit `object.__eq__`/`__hash__` so a future `eq=True` regression fails loudly). INV-034 → ✅ ENFORCED; divergence class 6 → ✅ FIXED. **Note:** the original INV-034 framing named only `Character`/`Object`; `MobInstance`/`ObjectInstance` (separate non-subclass dataclasses that regenerate their own value-eq) were caught by adversarial review after the first commit — a single class's `eq=False` does not propagate to sibling entity dataclasses. **Follow-up (separate, lower priority):** `Room` is the same class (still `eq=True`) with lower risk (vnum-keyed singletons) — a Room identity test + `eq=False` flip can land independently.
- **Flag-hex sweep offenders resolved (no live behavior change) — deleted two dead-code landmines, routed two live constants through the enums.** Making the new `test_flag_hex_convention.py` guard green required resolving four parallel hardcoded-hex flag constants. (1) **Deleted `mud/handler.py::is_friend`** (HANDLER-DEAD-001) — a dead duplicate (no callers; the live mob-assist path is `mud/combat/assist.py`) that hardcoded **wrong** assist bits (`ASSIST_PLAYERS = 0x1` bit 0, vs canonical `OffFlag.ASSIST_PLAYERS = 1<<18`; ROM letter macro `(S)`). (2) **Deleted `mud/handler.py::check_immune`** (HANDLER-DEAD-002) — a dead duplicate (no callers; the live RIV path is `mud/affects/saves.py::_check_immune`) that hardcoded wrong RIV bits (`IMM_WEAPON = 0x1` bit 0 / `IMM_MAGIC = 0x2` bit 1, vs canonical `DefenseBit.WEAPON = 1<<3` / `MAGIC = 1<<2`) and was only a WEAPON/MAGIC TODO stub. Both are textbook instances of the AGENTS.md "the hex you'd guess from the constant name is often wrong" warning — latent landmines, not live bugs. (3+4) Migrated the live, correct-valued `PLR_CANLOOT/NOSUMMON/NOFOLLOW` (`mud/commands/player_config.py`) and `COMM_DEAF` (`mud/commands/remaining_rom.py`) to derive from `PlayerFlag`/`CommFlag` (`int(PlayerFlag.CANLOOT)`, `int(CommFlag.DEAF)` — the pattern `remaining_rom` already used for `COMM_QUIET`). Values were already correct, so behavior is byte-identical; 114 combat/saves/resistance/affects tests + the guard pass. Filed durably as HANDLER-DEAD-001/002 in `HANDLER_C_AUDIT.md`.
- **INV-029 row-cell reconcile + async-delivery class reclassified A→C (follow-up to the divergence-class lens).** Acting on the lens's first two to-do items surfaced two corrections, both arrived at by re-verifying ROM/source rather than trusting the doc. (1) The INV-029 *row cell* in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` still listed `do_say`/`do_tell` cousins as "remaining OPEN / still uncapped" — an **internal contradiction**: its own watch-list already recorded them CLOSED via ACT-CAP-003/004 (2.11.42–43, committed tests `test_act_cap_003/004_*.py`). Corrected the stale status + enforcement clauses to match; only the `broadcast_global` weather path stays correctly uncapped. (2) The roster had placed async-delivery in **Layer A** (a committable static bypass-guard) "pending a guard." Attempting that guard proved it **infeasible**: legitimate hand-rolled XOR loops (`do_yell` uses `create_task(send_to_char)` + `continue` correctly) and diverse legitimate `.messages.append` sites (`Character.send_to_char`, broadcast primitives, actor-self lines) make any blanket bypass-grep false-positive. Per the `/rom-divergence-sweep` Phase-1 rule, that means it is **not Layer A** — reclassified to **Layer C** (enforced behaviorally by INV-001/027/029 + ACT-CAP-001..004 integration tests), with a Layer-B "review new delivery sites" element. (3) Added `tools/diff_harness/PROPOSAL_HYPOTHESIS_WIDENING.md` — a scoped proposal for Hypothesis-driven differential coverage (the only enumeration-independent path to *unknown* divergences). Docs/tracker only — zero `mud/` code changed.

### Changed

- **README honesty pass.** Reconciled the README's internal contradiction — the top framed the project as "trust rebuild in progress" while the bottom "Project Completeness" section still claimed "production-ready" with "100% behavioral parity." Both now consistently describe a feature-complete, green-suite engine in a verification trust-rebuild phase, and distinguish *audit-process completion* (every applicable ROM C file has an audit document) from *behavioral parity* (not yet certified bug-free — three prod bugs shipped this year against ≥95%-audited files). Unified four conflicting test counts (4,934 / 5,256 / 5,306 / 5,319) to the live `5329 passed`, bumped the version badge to 2.12.65, and added an "open parity gaps" note.

### Fixed

- **INV-001 wiznet — a CONNECTED immortal now receives wiznet lines on the immediate (async) channel, matching ROM `send_to_char` (sweep COMPLETE).** The last and trickiest site of the INV-001 wrong-channel sweep. ROM `wiznet` (`src/act_wiz.c:171-194`) writes each line straight to the descriptor via `send_to_char` — immediate, single-channel. Python's `mud/wiznet.py:_wiznet_deliver` appended unconditionally to `ch.messages`, so a connected immortal saw its wiznet lines late (drained on the next prompt). It was left mailbox-only in the earlier batches because its reconnect-announce callers (`_broadcast_reconnect_notifications`, `announce_wiznet_login/logout/new_player`) run **synchronously outside any event loop**, where a naive `push_message` migration tripped `asyncio.create_task`'s "no running event loop". Fixed by making `push_message` (`mud/utils/messaging.py`) **loop-aware** — it now probes `asyncio.get_running_loop()` and falls back to the mailbox when no loop is running, instead of raising — then routing `_wiznet_deliver` through it. A connected immortal serviced under the live server loop gets the immediate async send; the sync reconnect callers (and tests) fall back to the mailbox exactly as before, preserving the 4 reconnect tests that assert mailbox delivery. The `get_running_loop` guard is purely additive: every existing `push_message` caller runs under a live loop (combat ticks, command read loop, async nanny), so their behavior is unchanged — only the previously-raising no-loop case now no-ops to the mailbox. `gitnexus_impact` rated `push_message` CRITICAL (41 direct callers, 319 impacted) but the change is byte-identical for all in-loop callers. Full suite green — zero fallout. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv001_wiznet_delivery_channel.py` (connected immortal under a running loop: line lands once on the async channel, `messages == []`).
- **INV-001 inline delivery migration — combat position-change/split, `wake`, `pour`, spell incantations, the gold-changer line, and 7 inline spell room/victim lines no longer double-deliver or arrive late to connected PCs.** The second batch of the INV-001 wrong-channel sweep migrated the remaining hand-rolled inline delivery sites (those not going through a shared helper) to `push_message` / the `_send_to_char` helper (async-XOR-mailbox): `mud/combat/engine.py:_broadcast_pos_change` (position-transition room line) + the group-split per-member line; `mud/commands/position.py:do_wake` (`$n wakes you.`); `mud/commands/liquids.py` pour recipient; `mud/skills/say_spell.py:broadcast_spell_words`; `mud/commands/give.py:_append_message` (gold-changer "tells you" line — the GIVE-001 cousin); and seven inline `mud/skills/handlers.py` spell loops (satisfaction target, chill_touch / colour_spray / cure_blindness / cure_disease / trip room lines, colour_spray victim). `mud/music/__init__.py:_push_music_message` was made XOR (it keeps its connection-juggling `writer` fallback). Actor-self lines (charm/colour_spray caster) were left — they are drained right after the actor's own command and so are not observably late. `mud/wiznet.py` is a **deliberate exception** (filed, OPEN): its reconnect-announce callers run synchronously outside an event loop, so `push_message`'s `create_task` would raise — it needs a dedicated fix and stays mailbox-only for now. Full suite **5354 passed, 4 skipped** — zero fallout (combat/engine + handlers heavily exercised). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv001_inline_delivery_channel.py` (pos-change, wake, say-spell connected single-delivery).
- **INV-001 delivery-helper migration — `group split` / `steal` yell / mob-command echo / spell TO_VICT & TO_NOTVICT / `follow` no longer double-deliver to connected PCs.** Five more modules carried their own hand-rolled "fire-and-forget + mailbox" delivery helper that predated `push_message` and did BOTH channels (`if writer: create_task(send_to_char(...))` **and** an unconditional `*.messages.append(...)`), double-delivering to connected PCs. Migrated all to `push_message` (async-XOR-mailbox): `mud/commands/group_commands.py:_send_to_char_sync` (used by `split`/`group`/`order`) — also removed a redundant second mailbox append in `do_split` and routed the `do_follow`-path `add_follower`/`stop_follower` master/char lines through it; `mud/commands/thief_skills.py:_send_to_char_sync` and its inline steal-yell room loop; `mud/mob_cmds.py:_append_message`; and `mud/skills/handlers.py:_to_vict_send` + `_notvict_broadcast` (the shared spell TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT helpers). Surfaced by the INV-001 wrong-channel grep sweep. Full suite **5351 passed, 4 skipped** — zero fallout. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv001_delivery_helpers_channel.py` (each helper: connected single-delivery + disconnected mailbox fallback; `_notvict_broadcast` actor/victim exclusion). Remaining sweep sites filed for follow-up (inline `combat/engine.py` position-change + split, `position.py` wake, `liquids.py` pour, `say_spell.py`, `wiznet.py`, `give.py` changer, several `handlers.py` inline spell loops, and `music/_push_music_message` which needs care for its connection-juggling `writer` fallback).
- **ROOM-BCAST-001 — `Room.broadcast` no longer double-delivers to a connected occupant (INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY).** `Room.broadcast` (`mud/models/room.py`) is a delivery primitive used across production paths (mob speech in `spec_funs`, reconnect / link-loss notices in `mud/net/connection.py`, item-zap in `mud/groups/xp.py`, AI broadcasts in `mud/ai`, mob commands in `mud/mob_cmds.py`). Its docstring described the intended async-for-connected / mailbox-for-tests XOR, but the code did **both**: `if writer is not None: asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))` **and** an unconditional `char.messages.append(...)`. For a connected occupant the async send arrives immediately and the connection read loop drains the mailbox on the next prompt → the line was delivered **twice**. `broadcast_room`/`broadcast_global` (`mud/net/protocol.py`) were fixed to XOR in 2.11.6; `Room.broadcast` was the parallel primitive that was missed. Fixed by routing through `push_message`. Surfaced by the INV-001 wrong-channel grep sweep. Full suite **5342 passed, 4 skipped** — zero fallout despite the high fan-out. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv001_room_broadcast_channel.py` (connected occupant single-delivery + disconnected mailbox-fallback).
- **SAY-005 / SHOUT-004 / TELL-007 / EMOTE-004 — say/shout/tell/emote no longer double-deliver to a connected listener (INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY).** The per-listener PERS-masking rewrites of these four `mud/commands/communication.py` commands (SAY-002 / SHOUT-003 / TELL / EMOTE-001) used a hand-rolled loop that delivered each line via `if writer: asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))` **and then** an unconditional `listener.messages.append(...)` — BOTH channels. For a **connected** listener the async send arrives immediately and the connection read loop (`mud/net/connection.py:2002-2005`) drains the mailbox on the listener's next prompt, so the line is received **twice**. SAY-004 had fixed say double-delivery once; the later PERS rewrite re-introduced it, and the existing comm tests use **disconnected** listeners (mailbox-only → count 1) so they false-greened against the regression. Fixed all four by routing delivery through `push_message` (async send for connected PCs, mailbox fallback for disconnected chars / tests — the canonical XOR primitive); the separate `writer is None`-gated TRIG_ACT dispatch in say/tell is unchanged, and the linkdead/AFK/note-writing tell branches keep their (correct) deferred mailbox queue. `do_yell`'s loop was already correct (it `continue`s after the async send). Surfaced by an INV-001 wrong-channel grep sweep over all `*.messages.append` sites in `mud/`. Full suite **5340 passed, 4 skipped** — zero fallout on these core commands. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv001_comm_delivery_channel.py` (4 connected-listener tests asserting the line lands once on the async channel with `messages == []`).
- **GIVE-001 — `do_give` now delivers the recipient's "X gives you Y." line on the immediate (async) channel for connected PCs, matching ROM `act(..., TO_VICT)`.** ROM `do_give` writes the recipient's line straight to the descriptor via `act()` — immediate — in both the object branch (`"$n gives you $p."`, `src/act_obj.c:834`) and the coins branch (`~726`). Python delivered both via raw `victim.messages.append(...)`, the mailbox fallback a **connected** PC only drains on its next prompt, so a connected recipient saw the gift line **late**. INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY / MAGIC-003 wrong-channel family (the ACT_COMM-003 shape). The giver's TO_CHAR line was already correct (returned by `do_give`, sent by the connection loop) — only the victim leg was wrong-channel. Both legs now route through `push_message` (async send for connected PCs, mailbox fallback for disconnected chars / tests); `push_message` does not dispatch TRIG_ACT, so the object branch's `disable_mobtrigger()` contract (ROM `:832` MOBtrigger=FALSE) is unaffected. Surfaced while probing mob-trigger ordering (the give-trigger ordering itself is faithful — the object is in the victim's inventory before `mp_give_trigger`, and TRIG_DEATH/entry/greet ordering verified ROM-correct). `gitnexus_impact` rated `do_give` LOW. Existing give tests use disconnected chars (mailbox fallback) and stayed green; the new test uses connected PCs. Regression: `tests/integration/test_give001_victim_delivery_channel.py`.
- **ACT_COMM-003 — `stop_follower` now delivers its two lines on the immediate (async) channel for connected PCs, matching ROM `act()`.** ROM `stop_follower` (`src/act_comm.c:1626-1627`) writes both the TO_VICT `"$n stops following you."` and TO_CHAR `"You stop following $N."` lines straight to the descriptor via `act()` — immediate, single-channel delivery. Python used raw `char.messages.append(...)` for both, the mailbox fallback that a **connected** PC only drains on its next prompt; the sibling primitive `add_follower` was already migrated to `push_message`, so `stop_follower` was the leftover asymmetric cousin (INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY / MAGIC-003 wrong-channel family). The divergence is observable off the command path — `die_follower` iterating the registry on a leader's extract/death, or charm wearing off mid-tick — where the connection loop does not drain the mailbox right after. Both lines now route through `push_message` (async send for connected PCs, mailbox fallback for disconnected chars / tests), matching `add_follower`; the `can_see`/`in_room` gate (FOLLOW-002) and unconditional detach state are unchanged. `gitnexus_impact` rated `stop_follower` CRITICAL (27 impacted, 5 direct callers reaching death/extract/charm/shop/quit), but `push_message` is byte-identical to the old append for any char without a `.connection`, so disconnected chars and all existing tests are unaffected — only connected PCs change. Existing follow tests use disconnected chars and stayed green; the new test uses connected PCs (the disconnected pattern false-greens against unfixed code). Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_comm003_stop_follower_delivery_channel.py`.
- **INV-033 FURNITURE-ON-POINTER-COHERENCE — extracting/decaying furniture now clears every occupant's `ch->on` pointer (ROM `obj_from_room`).** A character's `on` furniture pointer must be cleared whenever the furniture leaves their room. ROM does this in two primitives: `char_from_room` clears `ch->on` when the *character* leaves (`src/handler.c:1532`, already mirrored in `Room.remove_character`), and `obj_from_room` (`src/handler.c:1915-1917`) clears every occupant whose `ch->on == obj` when the *furniture* leaves — and `extract_obj` routes room objects through it, so decay/purge/extract all clear the pointer. Python's canonical `mud/game_loop.py:_extract_obj` removed the object from `room.contents` but never cleared occupants' `on`, so furniture that **decayed or was purged out from under a sitter** left a dangling pointer that kept feeding the furniture heal/mana regen bonus (`hit_gain`/`mana_gain` read `ch->on->value[3]`/`value[4]`, ROM `src/update.c:217-218,299-300`) from furniture that no longer existed, and corrupted the no-arg `do_rest`/`do_sit`/`do_sleep` default (`obj = ch->on`). Added the `obj_from_room`-style occupant sweep to `_extract_obj`'s room branch — a strict no-op for non-furniture, so the 6 callers (decay tick, `do_purge`, mob purge/extract, `_destroy_light`, `_spill_contents`, the obj-manipulation wrapper) are unaffected for normal objects. `gitnexus_impact` rated `_extract_obj` HIGH (6 direct callers); full suite **5333 passed, 4 skipped** confirmed zero fallout. The guarded cousins `do_get` (`src/act_obj.c:126-134` occupancy check) and `do_sacrifice` already refuse to remove furniture someone is `on`, so they never strand the pointer. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv033_furniture_on_pointer_coherence.py` (extract, decay-tick, no-op safety, regen-bonus-stops).
- **HANDLER-004 — `is_name` now uses ROM's whole-word `str_prefix` + all-parts rule, not a substring match.** ROM's `is_name` (`src/handler.c:932-969`) requires each space-separated part of the search arg to be a *prefix* of some word in the namelist, and **all** parts must match. Python previously used a substring test (`name_lower in word`) with no all-parts conjunction, so `is_name("uard", "guard")` returned `True` (ROM: `FALSE`) and multi-word args like `"big guard"` failed to match `"guard big"` (ROM: `TRUE`). Rewrote `is_name` (`mud/world/char_find.py`) to mirror ROM's `one_argument` tokenization + `str_prefix` all-parts logic. `gitnexus_impact` rated this CRITICAL (7 direct callers fanning out to nearly every char/object-targeting command — tell, give, steal, murder, look, where, socials, OLC list filters, new-character name validation), but ROM itself calls `is_name` at every site, so the change moves all callers toward parity; the full suite (5329 passed, 4 skipped) confirmed **zero** fallout. Regression: `tests/integration/test_handler004_is_name_whole_word_prefix.py`.
- **HANDLER-005 — `get_char_world` now skips roomless chars (ROM `wch->in_room == NULL`).** ROM's world-list scan (`src/handler.c:2236`) skips any char whose `in_room == NULL` before the `can_see`/`is_name` tests, so a roomless char is never resolved world-wide. Python's loop omitted that guard — and it became a **live** divergence after VISION-001 (2026-05-29) dropped the `target_room is None` bail in `can_see_character`, making a roomless registry char (e.g. the `CON_GET_NEW_CLASS` wiznet subject) visible and thus resolvable. Added the `ch.room is None` skip as the first loop gate (`mud/world/char_find.py`). Surfaced by advisor review while closing HANDLER-003. Regression: `tests/integration/test_handler005_get_char_world_skips_roomless.py`.
- **HANDLER-003 — `get_char_room` / `get_char_world` now match the keyword `name` only, not `short_descr`.** ROM's room/world char lookup gates solely on `is_name(arg, rch->name)` (`src/handler.c:2207`, `:2237`) — the keyword `name` list, never the `short_descr`. Python additionally substring-matched the `short_descr` (and a defensive `keywords` field), so `look city` resolved "a city guard" (keyword name "guard") where ROM returns nothing. Both helpers now gate on `is_name(name, occupant.name)` alone (`mud/world/char_find.py`); the shared `is_name` helper is unchanged (it has other callers). Full-suite run confirmed **zero** caller fallout — callers/tests target mobs by keyword, not description words. Surfaced while closing HANDLER-002. Regression: `tests/integration/test_handler003_get_char_matches_name_only.py`. (Filed HANDLER-004 for the separate, still-open substring-vs-`str_prefix` divergence inside `is_name` itself.)
- **ACT_COMM-002 — normal `follow <other>` no longer emits a double "You now follow X." message.** ROM `do_follow`'s success path (`src/act_comm.c:1586-1587`) calls `add_follower(ch, victim)` and `return;` (void); the sole TO_CHAR emitter of the follower's confirmation is `add_follower`'s `act("You now follow $N.", …)` (`:1605`). Python's `add_follower` already appended `"You now follow {master}."` to `char.messages`, **and then** `do_follow` *also* returned `f"You now follow {victim}."` — the command loop sends the return value *and* drains `char.messages`, so a connected actor saw the line twice. The success path now returns `""` (`mud/commands/group_commands.py`), leaving `add_follower` the sole emitter to match ROM's void return. Same root cause as ACT_COMM-001, in the normal-follow path; surfaced by advisor review while closing it. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_comm002_follow_other_single_message.py`.
- **ACT_COMM-001 — `follow self` no longer emits a double "stop following" message.** ROM `do_follow`'s self-target branch (`src/act_comm.c:1562-1571`), when already following someone, calls `stop_follower(ch)` and **returns silently** — the only message is the `act("You stop following $N.", …)` emitted inside `stop_follower` (with the master's name). Python's `do_follow` called `stop_follower(char)` (which appends `"You stop following {master}."` to `char.messages`) **and then** returned a bare `"You stop following."` TO_CHAR string, so the actor saw the message twice (once named, once not). The self-branch now returns `""` (`mud/commands/group_commands.py`), leaving `stop_follower` as the sole emitter to match ROM's silent return. Pre-existing; surfaced during the HANDLER-001 14-caller sweep. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_comm001_follow_self_single_message.py`.
- **HANDLER-002 — `get_char_room` now counts each occupant at most once for `N.name` lookups.** ROM `get_char_room` (`src/handler.c:2205-2211`) gates each occupant with a single boolean (`if (!can_see || !is_name(arg, rch->name)) continue; if (++count == number) return rch;`), so `count` advances once per occupant. Python's helper split the match across a name/short_descr block and a separate keyword-list block, each running `count += 1`, so an occupant matching both advanced `count` twice — `2.<name>` could resolve to the first occupant instead of the second. Combined the name/short/keyword match sources into one predicate with a single `count += 1` (`mud/world/char_find.py:get_char_room`). **The double-count was latent, not a live divergence:** real `Character` instances never carry a `.keywords` attribute (the JSON loader stores keyword lists in `.name`), so the keyword block was empty for every real occupant — the audit row's "fires for typical mobs" claim was false and has been corrected. Behavior is identical for every real input; the keyword term is now defensive coverage. Filed pre-existing **HANDLER-003** (`get_char_room`/`get_char_world` also match `short_descr`; ROM matches only `name`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_handler002_get_char_room_count_once.py` (forces the multi-field match via `.keywords`; `2.guard` → second guard).
- **INTERP-026 — social target search now honors `can_see` + `N.name` (migrated onto `get_char_room`).** ROM `do_social` (`src/interp.c:637`) resolves the target via `get_char_room(ch, arg)`, which skips occupants the actor cannot see (`!can_see`, `src/handler.c:2207`) and parses `number_argument` `N.name` syntax (`2.guard`). `perform_social` used a hand-rolled `room.people` loop with a bare `name.startswith(arg)` test — no visibility gate (so `smile <invisible>` leaked presence as "You smile at someone." instead of "They aren't here.", the INV-027 family) and no count parsing (`2.guard` matched nobody). Migrated the victim search to the shared `mud/world/char_find.py:get_char_room` (now self-correct after HANDLER-001), closing self + no-self-skip + can_see + N.name together and deleting the hand-rolled loop. Filed pre-existing **HANDLER-002** (`get_char_room` counts an occupant twice when name+keywords both match, mis-selecting `N.name`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_interp026_social_can_see_and_nname.py` (`wibble <invisible>` → "They aren't here."; `wibble 2.guard` → 2nd guard).
- **HANDLER-001 — `get_char_room` no longer skips self by name (14-caller sweep).** ROM `get_char_room` (`src/handler.c:2194-2214`) returns `ch` for the `"self"` keyword (2203-2204) **and** iterates `in_room->people` with **no self-skip** — only `can_see`/`is_name` gates (2205-2211) — so targeting your own name finds you (and ROM's `can_see` short-circuits `TRUE` for `ch == victim`, so it works in the dark / while blind). Python's helper added `if occupant is char: continue` (`char_find.py:51`), so `<cmd> <ownname>` could never resolve to self; `get_char_world` was already inconsistent (its registry loop had no self-skip). Removed the skip; `can_see_character(ch, ch)` already returns `True` (`vision.py:158`). Swept all 14 callers against ROM C — no compensating guards needed (`do_consider` blocks via `is_safe`; `do_give`/`_give_money` have no self-guard in ROM either; `do_group`/`do_order`/`do_murder` already guard `victim==ch`; `do_recite`/`do_zap`/`do_pour`/`do_wake`/`look` legitimately allow self; `get_char_world` already returned self). **`do_steal` adjusted:** removed its substring pre-check (`arg2_lower in own_name`) that papered over the missing self-return and wrongly blocked stealing from others whose name is a substring of the thief's (e.g. "Bobby" stealing from "Bob"); the ROM `victim==ch` guard (`act_obj.c:2185-2189`) at `thief_skills.py:129` subsumes it. Updated four integration tests that targeted a mob by the token "test" — which now resolves to the actor (fixture player "TestPlayer", and ROM's `is_name` prefix-matches "test" → "TestPlayer") — to target the unambiguous "mob" keyword. Filed pre-existing **ACT_COMM-001** (`follow self` double "stop following" message) surfaced during the sweep. Regression: `tests/integration/test_handler001_get_char_room_self.py` (self-by-name, self-while-blind, `look <ownname>`, steal-substring).
- **INTERP-025 — self-targeted socials now reach `char_auto`/`others_auto`.** ROM `do_social` (`src/interp.c:637`) resolves the target via `get_char_room(ch, arg)` (`src/handler.c:2194-2214`), which returns `ch` for `"self"` (2203-2204) **and** iterates `in_room->people` with no self-skip (2205-2211), so socialing your own name finds you too — either path gives `victim == ch` → `char_auto`/`others_auto` ("You smile at yourself." / "$n smiles at $mself."). Python's hand-rolled victim search in `perform_social` did `if person is char: continue` and lacked the `"self"` keyword, so `smile self` / `smile <ownname>` fell through to "They aren't here." and the `char_auto`/`others_auto` branch was dead code. Fixed socials-local: the search now maps `"self"` to `char` and the people loop no longer skips `char`. Deliberately **not** routed through the shared `mud/world/char_find.py:get_char_room` — that helper has its own self-by-name divergence (it keeps the skip), and changing it is CRITICAL blast radius (14 callers); filed as **HANDLER-001** in `docs/parity/HANDLER_C_AUDIT.md` for a future per-caller sweep. Flipped `tests/integration/test_socials.py::test_social_targeting_self` from the bug-encoding not-found assertion to ROM-correct `["You smile at yourself."]`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_interp025_social_self_target.py` (`smile self` + `smile <ownname>` → actor "You smile at yourself.", room "Alice smiles at herself.").

- **INV-025 socials `$n` PERS class CLOSED — `socials.py` `act()` conversion (incl. a `TO_NOTVICT` victim-exclusion bug fix).** `perform_social` rendered every social line via `expand_placeholders` + `room.broadcast(exclude=char)`, baking the actor name once for all recipients: no per-recipient `$n`/`$N` PERS masking (an invisible socialer leaked its name to unaided witnesses, INV-027) and no `TRIG_ACT` dispatch to NPC bystanders (INV-025). It also delivered `others_found` to the **victim** — ROM `act(others_found, ch, NULL, victim, TO_NOTVICT)` (`src/interp.c:648`) excludes the victim, who must receive only `vict_found` (`TO_VICT`). Converted the room broadcasts (`others_no_arg`/`others_auto` `TO_ROOM`, `others_found` `TO_NOTVICT` with `exclude=victim`) to the shared `act_to_room` helper, and the directed lines (`char_*` `TO_CHAR`, `vict_found` `TO_VICT`, plus the NPC auto-react echo/slap and the not-found literal) through a new `_act_to_char` helper (per-recipient PERS via `act_format` + single-delivery `push_message` + `TRIG_ACT` to NPC recipients), mirroring ROM `act_new` (`src/comm.c:2230-2385`). `expand_placeholders` is retained for its other production caller (`commands/imc.py`). Tests: `tests/integration/test_inv025_socials_pers_sweep.py` (invisible-actor masking + `TO_NOTVICT` victim-exclusion); flipped `test_socials.py::test_social_with_target_excludes_actor_from_broadcast` from the bug-encoding `len(bob.messages) == 2` to ROM-correct `== ["Alice smiles at you."]`.
- **INV-025 command-layer `broadcast_room` PERS sweep (4th batch) + `act_format` PERS fidelity.** Closes the remaining baked-f-string / `act_format(recipient=None)` + `broadcast_room` group the prior batches walked past. Every site rendered a ROM `act("$n …", TO_ROOM)` line by baking the actor name into one string for all recipients (no per-recipient `$n` PERS masking — an invisible actor leaked its name to unaided witnesses, INV-027). Converted to the shared `act_to_room` helper (per-recipient PERS + TRIG_ACT) across: `position.py` rest/sit/sleep/stand (`_broadcast` helper); `session.py` `do_quit` (`act_comm.c:1482`); `inspection.py` `do_scan` look-around (`scan.c:60`) + directional peer (`scan.c:90`, `$T`); `healer.py` utter (`healer.c:183`, `$T`); `imm_load.py` `do_mload` (`act_wiz.c:2512`, `$N`), `do_oload` (`:2566`, `$p`), `do_purge` room (`:2605`) + `$N` TO_NOTVICT disintegrate/purge (`:2633/2645`, removed the bespoke `_notvict_broadcast` helper); `imm_search.py` `do_clone` object (`:2405`, `$p`) + mobile (`:2449`, `$N`). **`do_restore` TO_VICT** (`act_wiz.c:2809/2842/2863`) now renders `"$n has restored you."` via `act_format(recipient=victim)` so an invisible restorer masks to "Someone" per the victim's sight (self-restore keeps the name: ROM `PERS(ch,ch)` returns the name). **Shop** `do_buy` pet (`act_obj.c:2636`, `$N`) / item (`:2742`/`:2734` `$p[N]`) and `do_sell` (`:2923`, `$p`) baked the buyer/seller name into a bare `.broadcast` that **never dispatched TRIG_ACT** — converted to `act_to_room`, which adds the missing TRIG_ACT (shop PERS masking is unreachable: the keeper refuses an invisible customer, `act_obj.c:2395`). **`act_format._pers` PERS fidelity:** the conversions exposed two divergences from ROM `PERS` (`src/merc.h:2145`) — it returned `target.name` for NPCs (ROM uses `short_descr`) and had a non-ROM `"You"` self-case (ROM `$n` is always `PERS`, never "You"). Aligned `_pers` with `mud/world/vision.py:pers` (NPC→short_descr, PC→name, no "You"); production mobs were unaffected (`MobInstance.name` is already the short_descr) but the fix makes act() rendering correct when they differ and stops a created/cloned mob from seeing "… created You!". **`do_pose`** (`communication.py`, `act_comm.c:1425` — was `act_format(recipient=None)` + `broadcast_room`) and **`do_incognito`** (`admin_commands.py`, `act_wiz.c:4389/4395/4412` `"$n cloaks $s presence."` — was a `{name}`/`{poss}` `.format` + `room.broadcast`) were two more same-class stragglers, also converted (dropped the orphaned `_resolve_display_name`/`_possessive_pronoun` helpers). This closes the `act_format`/inline-f-string/`.format`-baked `broadcast_room` command group; the **socials `expand_placeholders` `$n` class** (`socials.py` → `models/social.py`, a separate mechanism over ~244 socials with no per-recipient PERS and no TRIG_ACT) is the remaining `$n`-baking room-broadcast in `mud/commands/` and is filed for the next pass (see CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025). Regression tests: `tests/integration/test_inv025_command_broadcast_pers_sweep.py` (sleep/quit/scan/peer/mload/oload/purge/clone/restore/pose/incognito), `tests/integration/test_shop_room_broadcasts.py` (buy TRIG_ACT dispatch).
- **INV-025 door-command PERS sweep — `doors.py:_broadcast_act_to_room` chokepoint reworked.** The helper took a pre-baked `f"{actor_name} …"` string, so open/close/lock/unlock/pick delivered the actor's identity to every witness un-masked (it did already dispatch TRIG_ACT). Reworked it to take a ROM `act()` format string (`$n opens $p.` / `$n opens the $d.`) and route through `act_to_room`; converted all 15 call sites (`act_move.c:384/412/436/492/515/534/622/655/690/757/790/825/907/945/981`). `$p` = portal/container object, `$d` = door keyword, `[N]`-style quantity unchanged. The reverse-side "The $d opens/closes." line has no `$n` and is left as-is. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_door_commands_pers_sweep.py`.
- **INV-025 give PERS sweep — `do_give` object + coins room lines now render `$n`/`$N` per-recipient, and the coins branch now dispatches TRIG_ACT.** `do_give` has two branches with opposite TRIG_ACT contracts: the **object** branch (`src/act_obj.c:830-846`) wraps its `act()` trio in `MOBtrigger = FALSE`/`TRUE` so the room line does NOT fire TRIG_ACT (the dedicated `mp_give_trigger` covers the event), while the **coins** branch (`:726`) is NOT suppressed and DOES fire it (`src/comm.c:2384`). Both baked the giver name via `act_format(recipient=None)` + `_broadcast_to_room_observers` (one baked string, no PERS masking, and a latent INV-001 double-delivery to connected PCs), and the coins branch never dispatched TRIG_ACT at all. Converted both to `act_to_room(…, exclude=victim)` (auto-excluded actor + `exclude=victim` = ROM TO_NOTVICT): the object branch stays wrapped in `disable_mobtrigger()` (TRIG_ACT suppressed, `mp_give_trigger` unchanged), the coins branch is plain so TRIG_ACT fires. Removed the now-unused `_broadcast_to_room_observers` helper. Reconciles the previously-✅ `do_give` audit row. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_give_pers_sweep.py` (object/coins invisible giver → "Someone"; object suppresses bystander TRIG_ACT; coins fires it). This closes the `act_format(recipient=None)` object/equipment/give class; a remaining baked-f-string `broadcast_room` group (`imm_load.py` mload/oload/purge, `session.py` quit, `inspection.py` scan/peer, `position.py` rest/sit/sleep, `healer.py` utter, `imm_search.py` clone, and the `doors.py:_broadcast_act_to_room` open/close/lock/unlock sites) is filed for the next pass — see CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025.
- **INV-025 equipment PERS sweep — wear/wield/hold/light/remove/level-fail room lines now render `$n` per-recipient through PERS masking (and the hold line uses ROM's `$s` gendered possessive).** `equipment.py` emitted its ROM `act("$n …", TO_ROOM)` lines as baked `f"{ch.name} …"` f-strings (and the wear-by-slot path via `act_format(recipient=None)`) piped to `broadcast_room`, leaking an invisible actor's name; the HOLD line additionally used a literal `"in their hand."` where ROM (`src/act_obj.c:1674`) uses `"$n holds $p in $s hand."` (gendered possessive). Converted every site to `act_to_room` (per-recipient PERS + TRIG_ACT — TRIG_ACT was already dispatched via a paired `mp_act_trigger_room`): level-fail `:1410`, remove (`_unequip_to_inventory`) `:1389`, light `:1419`, hold `:1674` (possessive fixed), wear-by-slot `:1435-1612` (×2), wield `:1639`. Reconciles the previously-✅ WEAR-004 row (visible text was fixed, the `$n` leak + hold possessive were not). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_equipment_pers_sweep.py` (wear/wield/hold/light/level-fail: invisible actor → "Someone"; hold → "Someone holds … in her hand").
- **INV-025 object-command PERS sweep — get/drop/put/sacrifice/quaff/eat/drink/fill/pour and scroll/staff/wand room lines now render `$n` per-recipient through PERS masking.** The object commands emitted their ROM `act("$n …", TO_ROOM)` room lines as `act_format("$n …", recipient=None, actor=char)` (which, with no viewer, returns the actor's raw name) piped to `broadcast_room` — one baked string for every recipient, leaking an invisible actor's name to unaided witnesses (INV-027). TRIG_ACT was already dispatched at each site via a paired `mp_act_trigger_room`, so this collapses the `broadcast_room` + `mp_act_trigger_room` pair into a single `act_to_room(room, "$n …", char, …, exclude=char)` that renders `$n`/`$p`/`$N` per-recipient (invisible actor → "Someone", visible NPC → short_descr, object visibility via `can_see_obj`) and preserves the per-NPC TRIG_ACT dispatch. Converted sites: `obj_manipulation.py` (put-on/in ×4 `src/act_obj.c:440/445/479/484`, remove `handler.c:remove_obj`, sacrifice self-decline `:1782`, sacrifice `:1856`, quaff `:1897`); `inventory.py` (get-from-container `:151`, get-floor `:158`, drop-coins `:586`, drop `:608/632`, melt-drop smoke `$p`); `consumption.py` (eat `:1317`, eat-poison choke `:1342`, drink `:1238`, drink-poison choke `:1263`); `liquids.py` (fill `:1025`, pour-for-char TO_NOTVICT `:1155`, pour obj→obj `:1142`, pour-out `:1075`); `magic_items.py` (`_broadcast` helper now delegates to `act_to_room`: recite `:1955`, brandish `:2008`/nothing-happens/`:2056` blaze, zap `:2121`/`:2129`/smoke-and-sparks/`:2149` explode). Reconciles the previously-✅ RECITE-002/BRANDISH-004/ZAP-004 rows, which had fixed the visible text via `act_format`+`broadcast_room` but left the `$n` actor leak. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_obj_command_pers_sweep.py` (get/drop/put/quaff/eat/sacrifice: invisible actor → "Someone", sighted witness → name).
- **NUKEPET-001 — `nuke_pets`' "$N slowly fades away." now obeys ROM's TO_NOTVICT + PERS + TRIG_ACT.** ROM `nuke_pets` (`src/act_comm.c:1648`) dismisses a charmed pet via `act("$N slowly fades away.", ch, NULL, pet, TO_NOTVICT)`. Python's `_nuke_pets` (the shared chokepoint for combat death, PC-extract, quit/disconnect, mob_cmds, and imm slay) had three divergences: it baked `$N`=pet name via `expand_placeholders` (leaking an invisible pet's name), excluded only the pet (`broadcast(..., exclude=pet)`) so the **owner** wrongly saw the fade line where ROM `TO_NOTVICT` excludes both owner and pet, and never dispatched TRIG_ACT to listening NPCs. Converted to `act_to_room(pet_room, "$N slowly fades away.", victim, arg2=pet, exclude=pet)` — invisible pet → "Someone", owner excluded, per-NPC TRIG_ACT fires. Surfaced by advisor review while closing FIGHT-041/042. Regression: `tests/integration/test_nukepet001_pet_fade_pers_and_notvict.py`.
- **FIGHT-042 — `death_cry`'s neighbor-room cry now dispatches TRIG_ACT to listening NPCs.** ROM `death_cry` fires the cry into each adjacent room via `act(msg, ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` (`src/fight.c:1685`) with no `MOBtrigger = FALSE` wrap, so an NPC in a neighbor room with a matching `TRIG_ACT` mprog receives `mp_act_trigger`. Python's `_broadcast_neighbor_cry` used `target.broadcast(message)` — visible-text delivery only, no TRIG_ACT dispatch (INV-025's primary contract; sibling of FIGHT-041, surfaced by advisor review of the FIGHT-041 "plain broadcast" claim). Converted to `act_to_room(target, message, victim)`; the cry has no `$n`/name so PERS rendering is unchanged. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight042_death_cry_neighbor_trig_act.py`.
- **FIGHT-041 — `death_cry`'s in-room gore line now renders `$n` per-recipient through PERS masking.** ROM `death_cry` (`src/fight.c:1640`) broadcasts the selected death/gore line via `act(msg, ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`, so `$n` masks an invisible corpse-to-be to "Someone" for a sightless witness. Python had baked the name once via `expand_placeholders` + `room.broadcast`, leaking it to every listener (INV-025 class, found in the `mud/combat/` re-probe). Converted to `act_to_room(room, message_template, victim, exclude=victim)` — invisible victim → "Someone", visible NPC → short_descr, `$s` possessive gendered. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight041_death_cry_pers_masking.py`.
- **INV-025 command-layer PERS sweep — `do_practice`, `do_train`, `do_recall`, and note write/finish room broadcasts now render `$n` per-recipient through PERS masking.** The INV-025 passes had converted `_act_room` sites and `mud/skills/handlers.py` manual loops but never touched `mud/commands/`, where ROM `act("$n …", TO_ROOM)` lines were emitted as `room.broadcast(f"{char.name} …")` — leaking an invisible actor's name to unaided witnesses. Converted all confirmed sites to `act_to_room(room, "$n …", char, exclude=char)`: practice learned/`practices` (ROM `act_info.c:2787/2779`), train durability/power/stat (`act_move.c:1760/1777/1798`), recall pray/disappear/appear (`act_move.c:1575/1618/1621`), and note start/finish (`board.c:503/1181`, restoring the `{G..{x` colour and the finish-line `$s` possessive). A visible named PC renders identically; only invisible-actor masking (and visible-NPC short_descr) changes. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_command_layer_pers.py`.
- **FIGHT-040 — dirt-kick already-blinded check now uses ROM's gendered `$E` message, in ROM's order, without the invented "dirt kicking" guard.** ROM `do_dirt` (`src/fight.c:2521-2528`) has one already-affected check — `if (IS_AFFECTED(victim, AFF_BLIND)) act("$E's already been blinded.", ch, NULL, victim, TO_CHAR)` — and it runs *before* the `victim == ch` "Very funny." check. Python (1) baked the victim name (`"{name} is already blinded."`) instead of the gendered `$E` (He/She/It), (2) carried a Python-invented second guard `if victim.has_spell_effect("dirt kicking"): "{name} already has dirt in their eyes."` with no ROM equivalent (and dead code — the dirt-kick effect sets `AFF_BLIND`, so the AFF_BLIND check already catches a re-kick), and (3) checked `victim == ch` before the AFF_BLIND check. Reordered to match ROM, switched the message to `act_format("$E's already been blinded.", recipient=caster, actor=caster, arg2=victim)`, and deleted the invented guard. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight040_dirt_already_blinded.py`.
- **FIGHT-039 — trip self-trip lines now carry `{5..{x` colour, `$n` PERS masking, and `$s` gendered possessive.** When you trip yourself (`victim == ch`), ROM `do_trip` (`src/fight.c:2699-2701`) sends `send_to_char("{5You fall flat on your face!{x\n\r", ch)` and `act("{5$n trips over $s own feet!{x", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`. The Python `trip` handler dropped the colour on the self line, and the room line baked the name (no `$n` masking), used literal "their" (not `$s`), dropped the colour, and delivered via the `messages.append` mailbox channel. The self line is now coloured and the room leg routes through `act_to_room(room, "{5$n trips over $s own feet!{x", caster, exclude=caster)`. Surfaced + split out of the MAGIC-014 sweep (colour + `$s`, not `$n`-only). Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight039_trip_self_room_pers.py`.
- **MAGIC-014 — single-actor `$n` spell room lines (haste, slow, giant strength, stone skin, pass door, sleep, weaken, earthquake, create rose) now render per-recipient through PERS masking.** Batch closure of the INV-025 manual-room-loop sweep remainder: ~11 handlers emitted their ROM `act("$n …", actor, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` room lines by baking `_character_name()` into a `room.broadcast(...)` call or a hand-rolled `for occupant in room.people` loop, with an `if target.name else "Someone …"` ternary for nameless actors. Two divergences: an **invisible actor** leaked its name (no `can_see` gate), and a **visible NPC** rendered the literal "Someone …" instead of its `short_descr` (ROM `$n`→`PERS`→short_descr). All converted to `act_to_room(room, "$n …", actor, exclude=actor)`. All sites are `$n`-only (no `$s`), so a visible named PC renders identically. Pinned two `slow` tests (`test_skills_debuffs.py`) from `Sector.FIELD`→`CITY` so the render is deterministic under leaked global sunlight (an outdoor room is dark at night → ROM-correctly masks, but non-deterministically). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic014_single_actor_room_pers_sweep.py`. The `trip` self-trip line (colour + `$s`) was split out as FIGHT-039.
- **MAGIC-013 — cure_disease success room line now renders `$n`/`$s` per-recipient through PERS masking + gendered possessive, and via the immediate channel.** ROM `spell_cure_disease` (`src/magic.c:1658`) broadcasts `act("$n looks relieved as $s sores vanish.", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`. The Python `cure_disease` handler had two divergences in this one leg: it baked the victim name + literal "their" (no `$n` masking, wrong `$s` possessive — MAGIC-012 class), and delivered via the divergent `occupant.messages.append` mailbox channel instead of the immediate per-recipient path (MAGIC-003 class). Converted the dispel-success room leg in `mud/skills/handlers.py:cure_disease` to `act_to_room(room, "$n looks relieved as $s sores vanish.", victim, exclude=victim)`, fixing both. Re-baselined `tests/test_skills_healing.py:60` ("their"→"its", a sexless Sex.NONE test char). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic013_cure_disease_room_pers_masking.py` (male→"his", invisible victim→"Someone"+"her").
- **MAGIC-012 — frenzy success room line now renders `$n`/`$s` per-recipient through PERS masking + gendered possessive.** ROM `spell_frenzy` (`src/magic.c:2961`) broadcasts `act("$n gets a wild look in $s eyes!", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c` masks an invisible victim's `$n` to "someone" and renders `$s` as the victim's gendered possessive (his/her/its). The Python `frenzy` handler used a hand-rolled `for occupant in room.people` loop emitting `f"{name} gets a wild look in their eyes!"` — no masking, wrong possessive. Converted the room leg in `mud/skills/handlers.py:frenzy` to `act_to_room(room, "$n gets a wild look in $s eyes!", target, exclude=target)`. Root-cause class: the INV-025/027 PERS-masking sweep converted `_act_room` call sites but not handlers with manual room loops; `cure_disease` (MAGIC-013) is the sibling, filed open. Surfaced probing FINDING-015. Re-baselined `tests/test_skills_buffs.py:128` ("their"→"its", a sexless Sex.NONE test char). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic012_frenzy_room_pers_masking.py` (male→"his", invisible victim→"Someone"+"her").
- **TRAIN-005 — bare `train` now shows the session count *and* the trainable-stat listing, matching ROM.** ROM `do_train` (`src/act_move.c:1658-1663`) prints "You have N training sessions." then sets `argument = "foo"` and falls through; "foo" matches no stat/hp/mana, so control reaches the listing branch (`:1713`) and the player also sees "You can train: str int wis dex con hp mana". Python early-returned just the session count, omitting the list. The no-arg branch in `mud/commands/advancement.py` `do_train` now emits the session count as a `session_prefix` and sets `args = "foo"` so it falls through, prepending the prefix to all four listing-branch returns (the three Jordan easter-egg lines + the listing). Surfaced 2026-05-31 by advisor review while closing TRAIN-003. Regression: `tests/integration/test_recall_train_commands.py::test_train_no_arg_falls_through_to_listing`.
- **CAST-009 — a failed cast now trains the spell skill, matching ROM.** ROM `do_cast` (`src/magic.c:551-554`) calls `check_improve(ch, sn, FALSE, 1)` inside the concentration-lost branch *before* deducting half mana — failing a spell is a valid path to improving it (core skill progression). Python's failure branch returned `"You lost your concentration."` before ever reaching `_check_improve`, so a failed cast never improved the skill; the lone `_check_improve(...)` call only ran on the success path. Added `skill_registry._check_improve(char, skill, skill.name, False)` to the failure branch (`mud/commands/combat.py` `do_cast`) ahead of the `c_div(mana_cost, 2)` deduction. Pre-existing divergence surfaced 2026-05-31 by advisor review while closing CAST-008. Regression: `tests/integration/test_cast_009_failed_cast_improves_skill.py`.
- **MAGIC-004 — chain_lightning room/victim lines now render `$n`/`$N` per-recipient through PERS masking.** ROM `spell_chain_lightning` (`src/magic.c:1234-1307`) emits its visible lines through `act()`, so `comm.c` masks an actor a recipient cannot see to "someone" — first strike `:1244` TO_ROOM `"A lightning bolt leaps from $n's hand and arcs to $N."` (excludes only `ch`; the victim is a recipient — it is `TO_ROOM`, not TO_NOTVICT), `:1246` TO_CHAR, `:1248` TO_VICT, and the chain-bounce `:1270` TO_ROOM `"The bolt arcs to $n!"`. The Python port baked the caster/victim names into every leg, leaking the names of invisible/unseen actors (INV-027). Converted the 5 token-bearing legs in `mud/skills/handlers.py:chain_lightning` to `act_to_room`/`act_format`; because every token is mid-sentence, a masked actor renders lowercase "someone" (`act` only capitalizes the buffer's first letter). **Audit-ref correction:** the audit row over-stated this as a structural "3-way split collapse" with a `TO_NOTVICT` first strike — the real ROM is `TO_ROOM` and the Python already had the three legs; the only divergence was the baked names. Corrected in the audit doc. Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic004_chain_lightning_pers_masking.py` (4 tests).
- **FIGHT-038 — a NOREMOVE ("won't budge") disarm now credits skill improvement as a success, matching ROM.** ROM `do_disarm` (`src/fight.c:3202-3217`) only enters its success branch on a made roll, and that branch unconditionally calls `check_improve(ch, gsn_disarm, TRUE, 1)` (`:3206`) after `disarm(ch, victim)` — the NOREMOVE case lives *inside* `disarm()` (`:2242-2249`), which emits the budge messages and returns, so control falls back to `:3206` and the disarm is still credited TRUE. Python's NOREMOVE early-return called `check_improve(caster, "disarm", False, 1)`, crediting a failure. Changed to `True` in `mud/skills/handlers.py:disarm`. Pre-existing divergence surfaced by advisor review while closing FIGHT-035. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight038_disarm_noremove_improve.py`.
- **FIGHT-035 — disarm now uses ROM's TO_CHAR/TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT split with `{5..{x` colour and per-recipient PERS, fixing the double-broadcast bug.** ROM splits every disarm outcome into three `act()` legs, and the TO_NOTVICT leg (`act(buf, ch, NULL, victim, TO_NOTVICT)`) excludes **both** the kicker and the victim — fail path `src/fight.c:3211-3215` (`do_disarm`), NOREMOVE branch `:2244-2248` and success `:2252-2255` (`disarm` helper). Python rendered the TO_NOTVICT line through a helper that excluded only **one** actor, so the other actor double-received the third-person room line; it also baked both names (no `$n`/`$N` PERS masking), dropped the `{5`/`{x` colour, lower-cased ROM's "DISARMS", and rendered `$S` (victim's gendered possessive in the "won't budge" line) as `"<name>'s"`. Rebuilt all three paths in `mud/skills/handlers.py:disarm`: TO_CHAR/TO_VICT via `act_format` (PERS + colour + `$S` possessive + restored "DISARMS" caps), TO_NOTVICT via `act_to_room(actor=caster, exclude=victim)` so neither actor double-receives and bystanders get it exactly once. **ROM-ref note:** the audit row originally cited `:2245-2255` for the fail path; the real skill-roll fail is `do_disarm:3211-3215` — corrected in the audit doc. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight035_disarm_act_structure.py` (4 tests). Re-baselined `tests/test_skills_combat.py:164` ("disarms you"→"DISARMS you…").
- **FIGHT-037 — dirt-kick victim legs now carry `{5..{x` colour + `$n` PERS masking, and the invented caster self-line is removed.** ROM `do_dirt` success branch (`src/fight.c:2611-2631`) emits three visible lines on a hit: the `:2614` TO_ROOM blind line (handled by FIGHT-036), the `:2616` TO_VICT `act("{5$n kicks dirt in your eyes!{x", ch, NULL, victim, TO_VICT)`, and the `:2618` `send_to_char("{5You can't see a thing!{x\n\r", victim)` — and sends the **kicker no self message** (the kicker only sees the `:2614` blind line as a room recipient). Python (1) baked the kicker name and dropped the colour on the TO_VICT leg, (2) dropped the colour on the victim self-line, and (3) invented a `"You kick dirt in <victim>'s eyes!"` caster line ROM never emits. The TO_VICT leg in `mud/skills/handlers.py:dirt_kicking` now renders via `act_format("{5$n kicks dirt in your eyes!{x", recipient=victim, actor=caster)` (`$n` masks an invisible kicker to "Someone" per INV-027, colour preserved), the victim self-line is now `"{5You can't see a thing!{x"`, and the invented caster line is removed. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight037_dirt_kick_victim_legs.py` (4 tests). Completes the `do_dirt` surface alongside FIGHT-036.
- **MAGIC-011 — poison food/drink caster line now capitalized, matching ROM `act(TO_ALL)`.** ROM `spell_poison` food/drink branch (`src/magic.c:3946`) emits `act("$p is infused with poisonous vapors.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ALL)`, and `act_new` upper-cases the first visible letter for **every** recipient — including the caster `ch` — inside the per-recipient delivery loop (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`). So the caster sees `"Loaf of bread is infused with poisonous vapors."` (capital L). Python's food caster leg emitted the short_descr verbatim with no `capitalize_act_line` while the sibling **weapon** caster leg (`:3981`) *was* capped — a missed site under the closed ACT-CAP-002 invariant (INV-029). The food caster leg in `mud/skills/handlers.py:poison` now wraps `capitalize_act_line`, matching the weapon leg. Re-baselined `tests/test_skills_debuffs.py:190` and `tests/integration/test_magic005_poison_object_pers_masking.py:113` ("loaf of bread"→"Loaf of bread"). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic011_poison_food_caster_caps.py` (2 tests).
- **FIGHT-036 — dirt-kick blind room line now uses ROM's `$s eyes` gendered possessive, `$n` PERS masking, and `{5..{x` colour.** ROM `do_dirt` (`src/fight.c:2614`) broadcasts `act("{5$n is blinded by the dirt in $s eyes!{x", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c` renders `$n` per recipient via `PERS(victim, to)` (an invisible victim masks to "someone"), `$s` as the victim's gendered possessive (his/her/its), and preserves the `{5`/`{x` colour codes. Python baked `_character_name(victim)` and the literal "their eyes" into the room broadcast via the module-level `_act_room` helper, dropping the colour — no masking, wrong possessive, no colour. The room leg in `mud/skills/handlers.py:dirt_kicking` now routes through the shared `act_to_room("{5$n ... $s eyes!{x", victim, exclude=victim)` helper. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight036_dirt_kick_pronoun_masking.py` (male→"his", female→"her", invisible victim→"Someone"). Filed FIGHT-037 for the out-of-scope siblings surfaced while reading `do_dirt` (TO_VICT/victim-self legs drop colour; Python invents a caster "You kick dirt…" line ROM never emits).
- **MAGIC-006 — plague room line now uses ROM's `$s skin` gendered possessive and `$n` PERS masking.** ROM `spell_plague` (`src/magic.c:3921`) broadcasts `act("$n screams in agony as plague sores erupt from $s skin.", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c` renders `$n` per recipient via `PERS(victim, to)` (an invisible victim masks to "someone") and `$s` as the victim's gendered possessive (his/her/its). Python baked `_character_name(victim)` and the literal "their skin" into the room broadcast via the module-level `_act_room` helper — neither masking an invisible victim (INV-027) nor matching ROM's gendered possessive. The room leg in `mud/skills/handlers.py:plague` now routes through the shared `act_to_room("$n ... $s skin.", victim, exclude=victim)` helper. Updated `tests/test_skills_debuffs.py::test_plague_applies_affect_and_messages` (a sexless test character defaults to `Sex.NONE` → "its", not the literal "their"). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic006_plague_pronoun_masking.py` (male→"his", female→"her", invisible victim→"Someone").
- **MAGIC-005 — poison-object room broadcasts now render per-recipient through `can_see_obj` masking.** ROM `spell_poison` object branch emits the weapon/food poison lines as `act("$p is coated with deadly venom.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ALL)` (`src/magic.c:3981`) and `act("$p is infused with poisonous vapors.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ALL)` (`:3946`), so `comm.c` expands `$p` per recipient via `can_see_obj` — a recipient who cannot see the object (blind, dark room, or the object invisible without detect-invis) sees `"something"`. Python baked `_object_short_descr(obj)` into the room broadcast via the module-level `_act_room` (no visibility check), leaking the name. Both room legs in `mud/skills/handlers.py:poison` now route through the shared `act_to_room("$p ...", caster, arg1=obj, exclude=caster)` helper. Poison does NOT set `ITEM_INVIS` (unlike MAGIC-010), so the caster `_send_to_char` leg keeps the baked short_descr (the caster targeted a visible object) — weapon leg capped per ACT-CAP-002, food leg uncapped, both unchanged. Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic005_poison_object_pers_masking.py` (blind witness masks weapon + food to "Something …", sighted witness sees the short_descr).
- **MAGIC-010 — object-invisibility fade-out now masks the caster too, not just the room.** ROM `spell_invisibility` object branch (`src/magic.c:3620-3641`) calls `affect_to_obj` to set `ITEM_INVIS` (`:3638`) **before** `act("$p fades out of sight.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ALL)` (`:3640`). `TO_ALL` includes the caster, and because the object is invisible at render time, `can_see_obj` (`src/handler.c`) returns FALSE for any char without detect-invis/holylight — so the caster AND every witness see `"Something fades out of sight."`, not the short_descr. Python baked `_object_short_descr(obj)` into a shared pre-capped message for both the caster `_send_to_char` leg and the `_act_room` room leg, leaking the name to everyone. Both legs now render `$p` per-recipient — caster via `act_format("$p fades out of sight.", recipient=caster, actor=caster, arg1=obj)`, room via `act_to_room(..., arg1=obj, exclude=caster)`. The same-branch "already invisible" early-out (`:3627`, `act("$p is already invisible.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR)`) shared the root cause and was folded in (`_send_to_char(caster, act_format("$p is already invisible.", ...))`). Updated the pinned baked-name assertions in `tests/test_skills_buffs.py` (584/585/618/619 → "Something fades out of sight.", 589 → "Something is already invisible."). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic010_object_invis_pers_masking.py` (3 tests: caster+witness mask, detect-invis witness sees the short_descr, already-invisible early-out masks).
- **MAGIC-007 — object-`$p` spell room lines now render per-recipient through `can_see_obj` masking.** ROM emits object-subject spell room lines as `act("$p ...", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ROOM/TO_ALL)`, so `comm.c` expands `$p` via `can_see_obj` per recipient (`src/handler.c`) — a recipient who cannot see the object (blind, dark room, or the object invisible without detect-invis) sees `"something"`, not the short_descr. Python baked `_object_short_descr(obj)` into the string once via the module-level `_act_room` (no visibility check), leaking the object name. Converted **every visible-object `$p` room leg** in `mud/skills/handlers.py` to the shared `act_to_room("$p ..."/"$n ... $p", actor, arg1=obj)` helper, each verified against its exact ROM `act()` format string: acid/fire effect inventory-burn (`src/magic.c:3156/3182/3214/3240`), bless object (`:808/:829`), enchant_armor (`:2358/:2370/:2418/:2427`), enchant_weapon (`:2556/:2566/:2614/:2623` — the TO_ROOM leg preserves ROM's `:2557` `"explodeds!"` typo byte-for-byte), fireproof (`:2785`), recharge (`:4158/:4195`), remove_curse object + per-item `$n's $p` loop (`:4233/:4268`), pick-lock (`src/act_move.c:907/:945`), and portal/nexus (`src/magic2.c:101/:155/:171`). Caster `_send_to_char` legs stay on the baked short_descr (the caster can always see a visible object they target). Object-invis `"$p fades out of sight"` (`:3640`, TO_ALL — the object is genuinely ITEM_INVIS at render time, masking the caster too) was filed separately as MAGIC-010; poison-object (MAGIC-005) and plague (MAGIC-006) remain open. Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic007_object_pers_masking.py` (fireproof — blind witness masks to "something", sighted witness sees the short_descr).
- **INV-025 / INV-027 — single-actor spell-effect room lines now use per-recipient PERS masking.** ROM routes single-actor spell room lines through `act("$n ...", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` (e.g. `spell_infravision` `src/magic.c:3598`, `spell_gate` `:2994`, `spell_teleport` `:4497`), so `comm.c:2230-2385` renders `$n` through `PERS(ch, to)` / `can_see` per recipient — masking an invisible actor (or any actor in a dark room) to "someone". Python baked `_character_name(actor)` into the string once via the module-level `_act_room` (`broadcast_room` + `mp_act_trigger_room`, no visibility check), leaking names. Converted 26 verified single-actor sites in `mud/skills/handlers.py` to the shared `act_to_room` helper (floating disc, gate ×4, summon/teleport/nexus/word-of-recall travel, infravision, invis, mass-invis fade, change-sex `$mself`, pink outline, purple smoke, word of divine power, blinding ray `$s`, poison/blindness saves, calm "looks more relaxed", etc.), using each line's exact ROM `act()` format string. Two-actor / object-`$p` / message-text divergences were excluded and filed: MAGIC-004 (chain_lightning TO_NOTVICT/TO_VICT split), MAGIC-005 (poison_weapon wrong text/subject), MAGIC-006 (plague `their`→`$s`), MAGIC-007 (object-`$p` sweep remainder), FIGHT-035 (disarm double-broadcast), FIGHT-036 (dirt-kick colour/`$s`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_spell_self_effect_pers_masking.py`.
- **MAGIC-008 — `invis` now broadcasts the fade-out room line before applying invisibility, matching ROM order.** ROM `spell_invisibility` (`src/magic.c:3650-3659`) emits `act("$n fades out of existence.", victim, TO_ROOM)` *before* `affect_to_char` sets `AFF_INVISIBLE`, so the actor is still visible at broadcast time and witnesses see the real name. The Python `invis` handler applied the affect first, then broadcast — harmless while the name was baked in, but once the line renders through per-recipient PERS it would wrongly mask the just-invisible target to "someone". Reordered to broadcast → apply → self-message; `mass_invis` already broadcast first. Exposed by the INV-025 single-actor PERS sweep. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_spell_self_effect_pers_masking.py::TestInvisBroadcastOrder`. Also pinned the unseeded to-hit roll in `test_combat_rom_parity.py::test_ac_clamping_for_negative_values` (it relied on leaked global RNG state and surfaced as a parallel-run flake once the invis tests completed instead of erroring).
- **INV-025 / PERS masking — cancellation wear-off messages now use per-recipient PERS rendering.** ROM `spell_cancellation` (`src/magic.c:1062-1196`) emits every wear-off "is no longer blinded" / "fades into existence" / "white aura vanishes" etc. line through `act("$n ...", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c:2230-2385` renders `$n` via `PERS(victim, to)` per recipient. Python's `_broadcast_room_msg` baked `_character_name(target)` once and broadcast it via `broadcast_room`, leaking invisible characters' names to unaided witnesses. Replaced with the shared `act_to_room` helper (per-recipient `act_format` PERS masking + per-NPC `TRIG_ACT` dispatch). Added `act_to_room` to `mud/utils/act.py` as the canonical shared helper for all `act(TO_ROOM)` surfaces. Refactored `game_loop.py:_act_to_room` and `movement.py:_act_to_room` to delegate to it. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_cancellation_act_pers_masking.py` (3 tests).

- **ENTER-018 / INV-025 — portal departure, arrival, and fade-out broadcasts now use per-recipient PERS masking before delivery.** ROM `do_enter` (`src/act_enter.c:134,151-154,204,209-210`) emits `"$n steps into $p."`, `"$n has arrived."`, `"$n has arrived through $p."`, and `"$p fades out of existence."` through `act(..., TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c:2230-2385` renders `$n` through `PERS(ch, recipient) / can_see()` separately for every watcher. Python `move_character_through_portal` and `_portal_fade_out` used `broadcast_room()` which baked `char.name` once, leaking invisible travellers' names to unaided witnesses. Switched to `_act_to_room()` (the same per-recipient PERS rendering path fixed for directional movement in MOVE-004). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_movement_act_trigger_dispatch.py::TestPortalPERSMasking` (2 tests: departure and arrival masking).

- **MOVE-004 / INV-025 — directional movement room lines now use per-recipient PERS masking before delivery and `TRIG_ACT`.** ROM `move_char` (`src/act_move.c:197,202`) emits `"$n leaves $T."` and `"$n has arrived."` through `act(..., TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c:2230-2385` renders `$n` through `PERS(ch, to)` separately for every watcher before dispatching the same buffer to `mp_act_trigger`. Python baked `char.name` once, leaking invisible movers' names to unaided occupants. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_movement_act_trigger_dispatch.py::TestDirectionalDepartureArrival::test_departure_uses_per_recipient_pers_masking`.
- **ENTER-017 — one-charge portal fade-out now happens before ENTRY/GREET mobprog triggers.** ROM `src/act_enter.c:200-222` fades/extracts an expired portal before firing `TRIG_ENTRY` or `mp_greet_trigger`. Python ran the trigger block first, making script/message order diverge on expiring portals. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_enter_gaps.py::TestEnter011PortalFadeOut::test_fade_happens_before_greet_trigger`.
- **MOBPROG-008 — `mp_give_trigger` now matches any token in non-numeric GIVE trigger phrases.** ROM `src/mob_prog.c:1309-1318` tokenizes phrases like `"dagger sword shield"` and fires when any token matches the given object's aliases, with `"all"` as a wildcard. Python treated the whole phrase as one string, so multi-token GIVE mobprogs silently missed valid objects. Regression: `tests/integration/test_mobprog_give_trigger.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — jukebox music `act(TO_ALL)`, `do_pose`, `_broadcast_level_fail`, and Mota decline `act(TO_ROOM)` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `src/music.c:128,154` jukebox broadcasts, `src/act_comm.c:1420` pose, `src/act_obj.c:1410` level-too-low, and `src/act_obj.c:1782` Mota decline all emit unsuppressed `act()` calls, so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python's music jukebox `_broadcast_jukebox_message`, `do_pose`, `_broadcast_level_fail`, and `do_sacrifice` Mota-decline branch only delivered the visible messages. Added trigger dispatch after each corresponding room broadcast. Jukebox dispatch formats `$p` per NPC recipient, matching ROM's per-recipient `act()` buffer before `mp_act_trigger`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_spell_effect_act_trigger.py` (5 new tests, 12 total).
- **INV-025 sweep — spell-effect, healer, spec_fun, and transport room broadcasts now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM emits all `act(TO_ROOM)` calls through `comm.c:2384`, which fires `mp_act_trigger` for NPC recipients. The spell-effect wear-off broadcasts in `cancellation` (`src/magic.c:1062-1196`), individual spell room lines (bless/blindness/chain_lightning/faerie_fire/fog/gate/holy_word/invis/mass_invis/sanctuary/shield/etc.), the healer utterance (`src/healer.c:183`), and spec_fun broadcasts (`_broadcast_room`, `_broadcast_room_message`) all dispatch TRIG_ACT — none are wrapped in `MOBtrigger = FALSE`. Python previously only delivered the visible room messages. Added `mp_act_trigger_room` dispatch via a new `_act_room` helper in `mud/skills/handlers.py` (50+ sites), modified `_broadcast_room_msg` inside `cancellation`, modified `_broadcast_room`/`_broadcast_room_message` in `mud/spec_funs.py`, and added dispatch to the healer utterance in `mud/commands/healer.py`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_spell_effect_act_trigger.py` (6 tests: cancellation wear-off, spec_fun broadcast_room, spec_fun broadcast_room_message, _act_room, actor exclusion, MOBtrigger suppression).
- **INV-025 sweep — movement departure/arrival, portal entry/fade, quit, and scan/peer `act()` room lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `move_char` (`src/act_move.c:197,202`), portal entry (`src/act_enter.c:134,151`), portal fade-out (`:204,209-210`), quit (`src/act_comm.c:1482`), and scan (`src/scan.c:60,90`) all emit unsuppressed `act(TO_ROOM)` calls, so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python `mud/world/movement.py`, `mud/commands/session.py`, and `mud/commands/inspection.py` previously only delivered the visible room broadcasts. Added `mp_act_trigger_room` dispatch after each `broadcast_room` call, with the correct actor and arg threading matching ROM. Sneaking characters suppress both broadcast and TRIG_ACT, matching ROM's `!IS_AFFECTED(ch, AFF_SNEAK)` guard. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_movement_act_trigger_dispatch.py` (8 tests).
- **INV-025 sweep — imm display `act()` room lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_invis` (`src/act_wiz.c:4342,4348-4350,4366`) and `do_incognito` (`src/act_wiz.c:4388,4398,4412`) emit unsuppressed `act()` calls for the fade-in/fade-out/cloak/uncloak room broadcasts, so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python's shared `_act_room` helper in `mud/commands/imm_display.py` only delivered the visible messages. Added `mp_act_trigger` dispatch on NPC recipients inside `_act_room`, mirroring the `imm_commands.py:_act_room_invis_gated` pattern. Also applied `capitalize_act_line` per INV-029. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_imm_display_act_trigger_dispatch.py` (7 tests).
- **AGENTS.md documents the differential testing harness (when/how to use).** Added a "Differential testing harness (`tools/diff_harness/`)" subsection + a replay command in the Build/Lint/Test block, so future agents know it's a fourth verification layer (ROM C ⇄ Python), how to run the pure-Python replay, author scenarios, and regenerate goldens — and that a divergence is a finding, not a golden to overwrite.
- **Diff-harness goldens re-verified against the instrumented C binary.** Rebuilt `src/diffshim` and ran `capture --check` (all 4 scenarios ok) then `--all`; the trace data is byte-identical (ROM C behavior unchanged), so only the `c_commit` provenance stamp refreshed to the current HEAD. Replay suite green (`tests/test_differential_smoke.py`, `tests/test_diff_harness_unit.py` — 12 passed).

### Added
- **Differential test harness merged to master (`diff-harness` branch).** Brings the ROM-C-vs-Python differential diff infrastructure onto `master`: `tools/diff_harness/` scenario runner + `compare.py`/`pysnap.py` drivers, golden JSON fixtures (`tests/data/golden/diff/`: `affect_armor`, `combat_melee_rounds`, `spell_combat`, `movement_get_drop`), the `src/diff_shim/diffmain.c` C shim, `tests/test_diff_harness_unit.py` + `tests/test_differential_smoke.py`, and the combat-RNG differential scenario design docs. Dev-tooling/tests only — no `mud/` engine changes. Clean auto-merge (29 commits), full suite green (5107 passed, 4 skipped).

### Fixed
- **INV-025 sweep — `do_clone` object/mobile room `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_clone` emits unsuppressed TO_ROOM creation lines for cloned objects and mobiles (`src/act_wiz.c:2405,2449`), so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python only delivered the visible room broadcasts. Added `mp_act_trigger_room` dispatch with `$p` as `arg1` for objects and `$N` as `arg2` for mobiles. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_clone_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — immortal load/purge/restore `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_mload` / `do_oload` (`src/act_wiz.c:2512,2566`), `do_purge` room and TO_NOTVICT lines (`src/act_wiz.c:2605,2633,2645`), and `do_restore` TO_VICT lines (`src/act_wiz.c:2809,2842,2863`) emit unsuppressed `act()` calls, so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python only delivered the visible lines. Added `mp_act_trigger_room` dispatch for the room/TO_NOTVICT paths and `mp_act_trigger` for NPC restore victims. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_imm_load_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — communication `say` / `tell` act() lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_say` emits an unsuppressed `act(..., TO_ROOM)` (`src/act_comm.c:776`) before the separate `TRIG_SPEECH` loop, and `do_tell` emits an unsuppressed `act_new(..., TO_VICT)` (`src/act_comm.c:942`) before its separate `TRIG_SPEECH` hook. Python delivered the visible say/tell lines and speech triggers, but skipped the act-level `TRIG_ACT` dispatch. Added per-recipient `TRIG_ACT` dispatch gated on `HAS_TRIGGER(TRIG_ACT)` / `MOBtrigger`, preserving the NPC-speaker anti-cascade speech gate. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_communication_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — immortal command `act()` room lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_transfer` (`src/act_wiz.c:870,873,875`), `do_goto` / `do_violate` bamf lines (`src/act_wiz.c:969-994,1026-1051`), and `do_force` single-target (`src/act_wiz.c:4316`) emit unsuppressed `act()` calls, so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python only delivered the visible messages. Added `mp_act_trigger_room` dispatch for `do_transfer` mushroom-cloud / puff-of-smoke room broadcasts and `mp_act_trigger` dispatch for the TO_VICT "has transferred you" notification on NPC victims. Added `mp_act_trigger` per-recipient dispatch inside `_act_room_invis_gated` (shared by `do_goto` and `do_violate`). Added `mp_act_trigger` for `do_force` single-target TO_VICT on NPC victims. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_imm_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — steal failure room `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_steal` failure path emits `act("$n tried to steal from you.", ..., TO_VICT)` and `act("$n tried to steal from $N.", ..., TO_NOTVICT)` (src/act_obj.c:2223-2224) through unsuppressed `act()` calls, so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python only delivered the visible messages. Added `mp_act_trigger` dispatch for the TO_VICT victim NPC and `mp_act_trigger_room` dispatch for TO_NOTVICT bystander NPCs. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_steal_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — `fill` / `pour` liquid room `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM routes `do_fill` and all visible `do_pour` variants through unsuppressed `act()` calls (`src/act_obj.c:1025,1075,1142,1151,1155`), so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python only delivered the visible messages. Added dispatch for fill, pour-out, object-target pour, and character-target pour's `TO_VICT` / `TO_NOTVICT` recipient split. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_liquids_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — magic item room `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM routes `quaff`, `recite`, `brandish`, and `zap` room narrations through unsuppressed `act()` calls (`src/act_obj.c:1897,1955,2008,2014,2058,2121,2129,2139,2151`), so `comm.c:2384` fires mob act triggers for NPC recipients. Python only broadcast the visible lines. Added trigger dispatch for `do_quaff` plus the shared magic-item broadcast helper, including iterable exclude support for zap's `TO_NOTVICT` recipient set. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_magic_items_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **INV-025 sweep — `do_eat` / `do_drink` room `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_eat` and `do_drink` emit their room-visible consume and poisoned choke lines via `act(..., TO_ROOM)` (`src/act_obj.c:1238-1241,1263,1317,1342`), so `comm.c:2384` fires `mp_act_trigger` for NPC recipients. Python only broadcast the visible lines. Added trigger dispatch for both commands while preserving the existing room delivery. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_consumption_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **GL-033 — mob current stats now use ROM's minimum floor of 3, not 0.** ROM `get_curr_stat` (`src/handler.c:868-874`) uses `URANGE(3, perm_stat + mod_stat, max)` for PCs and NPCs. `MobInstance.get_curr_stat` kept a Python-only `max(0, ...)` floor, which became reachable after GL-032 added NPC `mod_stat` support and also skewed directly-constructed zero-stat combat fixtures. Raised the NPC floor to 3 and re-derived bash/disarm/dirt-kick expectations against ROM's effective stats. Regression: `tests/integration/test_get_curr_stat_floor_three.py` (NPC floor cases) plus `tests/test_skill_combat_rom_parity.py`.
- **GL-032 — a charmed pet (NPC) now gains the AC / save / stat / sex benefit of buffs, not just hitroll/damroll.** ROM's `affect_modify` (`src/handler.c:1018-1164`) is one function for PCs and NPCs — it applies every `APPLY_*` location uniformly (AC, saves, stats, sex, hitroll, damroll, affect flags). `MobInstance.apply_spell_effect` (`mud/spawning/templates.py`) was a "simplified" applier that moved only `hitroll`/`damroll` and set the affect flag, silently ignoring `ac_mod`, `saving_throw_mod`, `stat_modifiers`, and `sex_delta` — so a charmed pet buffed with armor, giant strength, or a save-modifying spell got nothing from it (both live and, consistently, on reload). Brought the mob applier to parity with `Character.apply_spell_effect`: added a `MobInstance.mod_stat` list (ROM stores stat affects in `ch->mod_stat[]` for NPCs too, `src/handler.c:1072-1086`) and made `get_curr_stat` read `perm_stat + mod_stat`; `apply_spell_effect` now applies — and merges per `affect_join` on a re-cast — `ac_mod` (across all four armor classes), `saving_throw_mod`, `stat_modifiers` (via new `_apply_stat_modifier`), and `sex_delta` (clamped to the `Sex` range via new `_shift_sex`); `remove_spell_effect` unwinds all four symmetrically. The save/reload round-trip needed no serializer change — `_serialize_pet` already persists the folded-in runtime `armor`/`saving_throw`/`mod_stat`/`sex`, and GL-031's data-only restore re-counts nothing, so the bonus survives reload counted exactly once. Surfaced 2026-05-31 by advisor review while closing GL-031 (the ac_mod/stat_modifier round-trip assertions were non-mutating precisely because the applier ignored them). Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl032_mob_affect_application.py` (live ac/save/stat/sex apply, symmetric removal, round-trip-counted-once). **Follow-up now closed by GL-033:** `MobInstance.get_curr_stat` uses ROM's lower clamp of 3.
- **GL-031 — a charmed pet's spell-cast buffs now persist across save/reload.** ROM `fwrite_pet` (`src/save.c:508-517`) writes every entry on `pet->affected` by skill name; the Python port instead keeps spell-cast pet buffs in `MobInstance.spell_effects` (a `SpellEffect` dict, separate from the integer-SN `affected` list that `_serialize_pet` walks), and that dict was never serialized — so a charmed pet buffed with armor/sanctuary/giant-strength lost the buff on reload (GL-030 correctly skips the string-named shadow `AffectData`, but nothing else carried them). Added a `PetSpellEffectSave` dataclass + `PetSave.spell_effects` field; `_serialize_pet` now serializes `pet.spell_effects` and `_deserialize_pet` restores them. The restore is deliberately **data-only** — re-register the `SpellEffect` and mirror its shadow via `sync_spell_effect_to_affected`, but do **not** call `apply_spell_effect` — because ROM `fread_pet` (`src/save.c:1544-1573`) links each affect onto `pet->affected` **without** `affect_modify`: the saved `ACs`/`Hit`/`AMod` lines already fold in the affect bonuses, so re-applying the modifiers would double-count against the already-modified saved stats. (Primary-source correction to the audit's proposed "restore via `apply_spell_effect`" fix.) Surfaced 2026-05-31 while closing GL-030. Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl031_pet_spell_effect_persistence.py` (round-trips armor/sanctuary/giant-strength through the JSON dict form + asserts no double-application).
- **GL-030 — saving a charmed pet that carries a spell affect no longer crashes (regression from GL-027).** GL-027 gave `MobInstance` a real `affected` list whose shadow `AffectData` are keyed by spell **name** (a `str`, e.g. `"bless"`), mirroring the pet's `spell_effects` dict. `_serialize_pet` (`mud/db/serializers.py`, ROM `fwrite_pet`) was written for integer-SN affects and did `if affect.type < 0: continue` — `"bless" < 0` raises `TypeError` in Python 3, so saving any charmed pet that had been buffed or debuffed crashed the whole character save. Fixed by guarding the loop (`if not isinstance(affect_type, int) or affect_type < 0: continue`): string-named (spell_effects-managed) shadows are skipped — they're regenerated by `apply_spell_effect` — while integer-SN raw affects still round-trip. Surfaced 2026-05-31 verifying the pet save/reload round-trip after GL-027. Regression: `tests/test_pet_save_affect_roundtrip.py`. (A charmed pet's spell-cast buffs still don't *persist* across reload — `MobInstance.spell_effects` was never serialized, pre-dating GL-027 — tracked as GL-031.)
- **VISIBLE-001 — `visible` now actually strips cast invisibility (was a no-op that left a lingering effect).** ROM `do_visible` (`src/act_move.c:1549-1560`) does `affect_strip(ch, gsn_invis); affect_strip(ch, gsn_mass_invis); affect_strip(ch, gsn_sneak);` then clears the AFF bits — `affect_strip` removes the affect entirely. The Python `do_visible` (`mud/commands/thief_skills.py`) called `_strip_affect(char, "invisibility")` / `"mass invisibility"`, but the invisibility spells register `SpellEffect(name="invis")` / `name="mass invis"` (`mud/skills/handlers.py`) — the names never matched, so only the bare `affected_by` bit was cleared while the `spell_effects["invis"]` entry (and, after GL-029, its shadow `AffectData`) lingered, later firing a spurious "You fade back into existence." wear-off and leaving a re-settable INVISIBLE source on `char.affected`. Fixed by routing the spell-based strips through `char.remove_spell_effect("invis")` / `("mass invis")` so the dict entry, the shadow, and the AFF bit all clear symmetrically; `sneak` still uses `_strip_affect` (it's a raw `affected`-only Affect). Surfaced 2026-05-31 by advisor review while verifying GL-027's "fallback unreachable" claim. Regression: `tests/integration/test_visible001_strip_cast_invis.py` (full strip + no spurious wear-off).
- **GL-027 — a mob's spell affects now tick through ROM's affect loop, not the dict-only fallback (RNG-stream + expiry-timing parity).** A spell cast on a mob resolves to `MobInstance.apply_spell_effect` (`mud/spawning/templates.py`), which stored the effect in a `spell_effects` dict with **no** `affected` mirror — so `char_update` → `tick_spell_effects` (`mud/affects/engine.py`) routed it through the dict-only fallback, a divergent re-implementation of ROM's `char_update` affect loop (`src/update.c:762-786`). The fallback (1) decremented durations but rolled `number_range` **zero** times, where ROM rolls one `number_range(0,4)` unconditionally per `duration>0` affect (the GL-026 contract) — desyncing the global MM stream for every downstream consumer that tick (plague/poison damage, AoE saves, combat hit/miss) and beyond; and (2) expired a `duration==1` affect on the **same** tick (`1→0→remove`) instead of ROM's decrement-and-stay (remove only when re-entered at `duration==0` on a later tick). Fixed by giving `MobInstance` a real `affected` list and extracting `Character._sync_spell_effect_to_affected` into a shared `mud.models.character.sync_spell_effect_to_affected` helper (so the PC and mob affect-mirroring paths never drift): `MobInstance.apply_spell_effect` now mirrors shadow `AffectData` into `self.affected`, so modifier-bearing mob affects route through the same main `affected`-list tick path PCs use — one roll per `duration>0` affect, decrement-and-stay — and `remove_spell_effect` drops the shadow. The merge path also now mirrors `Character`'s remove-then-apply on a re-cast, fixing a latent double-apply of hitroll/damroll. Surfaced 2026-05-31 alongside GL-026 in the cross-file-invariants probe pass; chosen fix direction (b) — the ROM-correct "one affect list, one loop" end-state. Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl027_mob_affect_tick_parity.py` (RNG-stream consumption + decrement-and-stay).
- **GL-029 — flag-only spell affects (sanctuary/sleep/fly/…) now tick on the main affect loop instead of freezing or hitting the fallback.** Closing GL-027 by routing mobs onto the main `affected`-list path exposed a residual in the shared `sync_spell_effect_to_affected` helper: it emitted a shadow `AffectData` only for non-zero numeric modifiers, so an effect carrying only an affect_flag (or no modifier) produced none. Two failure modes: (a) when it was the character's only active affect it still routed through the dict-only fallback (zero RNG, off-by-one expiry); and (b) **a regression GL-027 itself introduced for mobs** — when a modifier-bearing affect was also active, `affected` was non-empty so the tick took the main path, which only visits affects present in the list, so the flag-only effect was never decremented and its duration **froze** for every tick the other affect stayed alive (effectively permanent under sustained combat re-casts). Pre-GL-027 mobs always hit the fallback, which decremented all `spell_effects` entries including flag-only ones. Fixed by having the shared helper emit one base `AffectData` (`location=APPLY_NONE`, `modifier=0`, `bitvector=flag`) when no modifier shadow was created, so flag-only effects tick on the main path for both PCs and mobs — and every active `spell_effect` now mirrors ≥1 `AffectData`, so the dict-only fallback is no longer reachable via the normal apply path. The "this shifts PC RNG streams, defer it" rationale proved an untested assumption: the full suite stayed green (5126 passed), so it was closed in the same commit. Caught by adversarial advisor review before push. Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl027_mob_affect_tick_parity.py::test_flag_only_affect_ticks_alongside_modifier_affect`. (The golden differential harness does not yet exercise a lingering mob debuff through the RNG affect loop — `spell_combat.json` casts only instant-damage magic missile — so the integration tests are the pin; a future scenario should tick a mob curse/sanctuary to expiry.)
- **GL-028 — an expiring spell effect on a mob no longer crashes the whole game tick.** ~40 spell handlers apply effects via `target.apply_spell_effect(effect)`; when the target is a mob this resolves to `MobInstance.apply_spell_effect` (`mud/spawning/templates.py`), which stores the effect in the mob's `spell_effects` dict but — unlike `Character.apply_spell_effect` — does not mirror it into an `affected` list. `char_update` ticks the whole `character_registry` through `tick_spell_effects`, so a mob with no `affected` list routes through the dict-only fallback, which calls `character.remove_spell_effect(name)` on expiry. `MobInstance` had **no `remove_spell_effect` method**, so the moment any spell cast on a mob expired, `tick_spell_effects` raised `AttributeError` — and because neither the per-character loop body nor the `char_update()` call in `game_tick` is wrapped in `try/except`, the exception propagated out of the entire tick (every character after the mob in the registry skipped that tick, along with `obj_update`/`pump_idle`/`aggressive_update`). Confirmed on the real `char_update` path, not just in isolation. Added `MobInstance.remove_spell_effect`, symmetric to its `apply_spell_effect` (unwinds exactly hitroll/damroll/affect_flag — the mob model never applies ac/saving/stat/sex mods). Surfaced 2026-05-31 while scoping GL-027 in the cross-file-invariants probe pass. Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl028_mob_spell_effect_tick.py` (spawn mob → cast weaken → tick to expiry; asserts no exception escapes and the effect is removed; bounded-ticks so it stays valid under the still-open GL-027 timing fix). **Known follow-up (GL-027, tracked):** the same fallback still rolls zero RNG per affect and expires `duration==1` one tick early — the deeper mob-affect-path divergence, filed in `docs/parity/UPDATE_C_AUDIT.md` pending a fix-direction decision.
- **GL-026 — affect-tick level-fade now consumes the RNG roll unconditionally (ROM stream parity).** ROM's `char_update` affect loop (`src/update.c:765-768`) does `if (number_range(0,4) == 0 && paf->level > 0) paf->level--;`. C `&&` is left-to-right short-circuit and `number_range` advances Mitchell-Moore state as a side effect, so the roll is consumed **for every affect with `duration > 0`, regardless of level** — `level > 0` is only tested afterwards to decide whether to decrement. The Python port (`mud/affects/engine.py:tick_spell_effects`) had the operands **swapped** (`if level > 0 and number_range(0,4) == 0`), so it skipped the roll whenever `level == 0` — and an affect's level reaches 0 naturally through the fade mechanic itself on long-lived spells. Every skipped roll desynced the global RNG stream for all downstream consumers in the same tick (notably the plague/poison `damage()` in `_char_update_tick_effects` that runs immediately after) and every tick thereafter. Reordered to roll first (`fades = number_range(0,4) == 0; …`), mirroring ROM's evaluation order. Narrow contract now locked: K affects with `duration>0` consume exactly K rolls, in list order, independent of level. Surfaced 2026-05-31 in the cross-file-invariants probe pass (affect-ticks candidate, RNG-ordering lens). Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl026_affect_tick_rng_consumption.py` (level-0 + multi-affect red-first; level>0 + permanent-affect controls). **Known follow-up (GL-027, tracked):** the dict-only fallback in the same function (reachable for `MobInstance` NPCs whose `apply_spell_effect` doesn't mirror into `affected`) rolls zero times — a worse desync, filed in `docs/parity/UPDATE_C_AUDIT.md`.
- **EMOTE-003 / INV-025 correction — `emote` no longer fires NPC act-triggers (was a player-forgeable exploit).** ROM `do_emote` (`src/act_comm.c:1090-1093`) wraps both of its `act("$n $T", …)` calls in `MOBtrigger = FALSE; … ; MOBtrigger = TRUE;`, and the trigger dispatch at `src/comm.c:2384` fires only `else if (MOBtrigger)` — so an emote **never** fires a `TRIG_ACT`. This is deliberate: emote text is free-form, so dispatching it would let any player forge an arbitrary trigger phrase (`emote bows` tripping an NPC scripted to react to "bows"). The 2.9.40 INV-025 enforcement mis-identified `do_emote` as the *canonical* `TRIG_ACT` producer and made `mud/commands/communication.py:do_emote` call `mp_act_trigger_room(args, char.room, char)` at runtime — a shipped behavioral bug. Removed the dispatch call; the per-listener message fan-out is unchanged (connected players still see the emote). The INV-025 suite was retargeted onto `do_stand` — a genuine ROM `act()` producer with no `MOBtrigger` wrap — so the contract's producer leg, MOBtrigger-gate leg, and actor self-exclusion leg are each still locked by a test that actually exercises its mechanism (the prior emote-based versions would have gone vacuously green after the fix). Surfaced 2026-05-31 in the cross-file-invariants probe pass (MOBtrigger-suppression sweep: `do_pmote`, `do_give`, `do_mpasound` were already correct; only `do_emote` over-dispatched). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_mobprog_act_trigger_dispatch.py::test_pc_emote_does_not_fire_act_trigger_on_listening_npc` (red-first against the pre-fix path).
- **INV-025 sweep — `do_open`/`do_close` reverse-side door broadcasts now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to linked-room NPCs.** ROM opens/closes the linked room's exit and narrates it per-recipient: `for (rch = to_room->people; ...) act("The $d opens.", rch, NULL, pexit_rev->keyword, TO_CHAR);` (`src/act_move.c:447-448` / `:545-547`). Because `TO_CHAR` collapses the recipient set to `{rch}` and the actor handed to `act()` is `rch` itself, the `src/comm.c:2384` dispatch fires `mp_act_trigger(buf, to=rch, ch=rch, …)` — the listening NPC is **both** recipient and actor. Python routed the reverse-side line through a plain `broadcast_room`, so a far-room NPC scripted to react to "The gate opens/closes." silently no-opped. Added `mud/mobprog.py:mp_reverse_act_trigger_room` (mirrors the per-`rch` loop: actor == recipient, no `ch` to exclude, honors the `MOBtrigger` guard) and wired it into both reverse-side sites in `mud/commands/doors.py`, alongside the unchanged `broadcast_room` PC delivery. Closes the last deferred INV-025 door follow-up (lock/unlock/pick have no reverse-side broadcast — ROM flips the bit silently). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_reverse_door_act_trigger_dispatch.py` (asserts the trigger fires on the linked-room NPC **and** that the actor threaded in is the NPC itself — the `act(..., rch, ...)` quirk).
- **INV-025 sweep — `do_close`/`do_lock`/`do_unlock`/`do_pick` now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM emits each door command's actor-room line via `act(..., TO_ROOM)` with no `MOBtrigger=FALSE` wrap (`src/act_move.c:534`/`:690`/`:825`/`:981`), so per `src/comm.c:2384` every NPC recipient with a matching `TRIG_ACT` mobprog must receive `mp_act_trigger`. Python routed these four commands through plain `broadcast_room`, so a mob scripted to react to "$n closes/locks/unlocks/picks …" silently no-opped — only `do_open` had been wired (the INV-025 follow-up gap). Swapped the two object broadcasts (`arg1=obj`) and the actor-room door broadcast (`arg2=keyword`) per command to the existing `mud/commands/doors.py:_broadcast_act_to_room` helper, exactly mirroring `do_open`. The reverse-side linked-room broadcasts (`doors.py:209`/`:302`) stay plain `broadcast_room`, matching the deliberate `do_open` precedent (tracked as a uniform open follow-up). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_door_commands_act_trigger_dispatch.py` (4 tests, one per command; all verified red against the pre-fix `broadcast_room` path).
- **TRAIN-004 / WIZ-050 — stat training & `set` now use the race/class-specific max, not a hardcoded cap.** ROM gates trainable/settable stats on `get_max_train(ch, stat)` (`src/handler.c:876`): `pc_race_table[race].max_stats[stat]` plus a prime-class bonus (**+3 for a human's prime stat, +2 otherwise**), clamped to 25. Two independent bugs converged on this: (1) `do_train` (`mud/commands/advancement.py`) hardcoded `max_stat = 22` in both the listing branch and the per-stat "already at maximum" check, so a human's STR (true max 18) over-capped and any non-uniform race (dwarf STR 20, elf DEX 21, …) was wrong; (2) the shared `mud.handler.get_max_train` — already used by `do_mset`'s `set char <name> <stat> <value>` ranges — was itself broken: it compared the **int** `ch.race` index against PC-race *name* strings and read a non-existent `class_num` attr, so for every real character it fell through a hardcoded `return 18`, capping all settable stats at 18 regardless of race. Fixed at the root: `mud.handler.get_max_train` now bridges the int race index to the PC race table by name (`get_race_by_index`→`get_pc_race`), reads the correct `ch_class` field, applies the ROM `+3 human / +2 other` prime bonus, and falls back to 25 (not 18 — ROM has no race_max fallback). The duplicate ceiling logic was removed and both `do_train` sites route through the one corrected helper, so `do_mset` ranges are fixed for free. Surfaced 2026-05-31 while probing TRAIN-004 (cross-file-invariants probe pass). Regressions: `tests/integration/test_recall_train_commands.py::test_train_caps_human_nonprime_stat_at_race_max`, `::test_train_caps_dwarf_dex_at_race_max`, `::test_train_prime_stat_gets_class_bonus`; `tests/integration/test_imm_set_stat_range.py::test_set_stat_uses_race_max_not_fallback`; corrected `tests/test_advancement.py::test_train_lists_only_unmaxed_stats` (had encoded the old "race_max + 4 = 22" assumption).
- **DB-001 / INV-032 — room flags now survive the `.are` → JSON → runtime pipeline (were dropped game-wide).** ROM `load_rooms` (`src/db.c:1158-1163`) reads the room header as `<area-number(discard)> <room_flags via fread_flag> <sector_type>`, where the middle token is a letter bitvector (`ADR`). `mud/loaders/room_loader.py` instead read `int(tokens[0])` (the discarded area-number field, always 0) and could not letter-decode bitvectors, so **every room in every area loaded with `room_flags = 0`** — no ROOM_DARK / ROOM_SAFE / ROOM_NO_RECALL / ROOM_LAW / access-control flags anywhere — and the converter baked those zeros into all 52 `data/areas/*.json`. Surfaced 2026-05-31 by in-game play (the school's "Darkened Room", vnum 3720, ROM flags `ADR`, was readable). Fixed: the loader discards `tokens[0]`, letter-decodes `tokens[1]` via a new `_parse_room_flag_field` helper (numeric-or-letter, mirroring `fread_flag`), reads `int(tokens[2])` for sector, and `assert len(tokens) == 3` fails loud on malformed headers. All 52 JSONs regenerated — verified flags-only (2064 flag-line changes, zero non-flag changes; the pre-fix loader regenerated all 52 byte-identical, proving no hand-edits to clobber). The ROOM_LAW "horrible hack" (`src/db.c:1161-1162`) stays a load-time semantic in `json_loader.py` (the converter serializes raw file flags); exit/door flags confirmed *not* affected (`_locks_to_exit_bits` already mirrors `src/db.c:1218-1238`). INV-032 flipped to ✅ ENFORCED. Regression: `tests/test_area_loader.py::test_room_loader_decodes_room_flag_letters` (loader unit) and `tests/integration/test_inv032_room_flags_survive_load.py` (full pipeline — room 3720 dark at runtime + >100 rooms flagged game-wide).
- **TRAIN-003 — `train` now requires a trainer (ACT_TRAIN NPC) in the room.** ROM `do_train` (`src/act_move.c:1643-1656`) scans the room for an `IS_NPC(mob) && IS_SET(mob->act, ACT_TRAIN)` mob and sends "You can't do that here." if none is present, before any session display or stat handling. QuickMUD had this gate commented out (stale "no trainer mobs exist yet" TODO), letting players train anywhere. Re-enabled `_find_trainer` (with ROM's `IS_NPC` guard, since PC `act` PlayerFlag bits can alias `ACT_TRAIN`=0x200). Surfaced while closing TRAIN-002 (the live world has trainers — e.g. Furey's adept in the school). Regression: `tests/integration/test_recall_train_commands.py::test_train_without_trainer_in_room_fails`. Train tests updated to place an ACT_TRAIN NPC (they had asserted train-works-without-trainer, contradicting ROM).
- **CAST-008 — failed spell casts now cost half mana, not 1.5×.** ROM `src/magic.c:551-558` deducts *either* `ch->mana -= mana / 2;` (failure) *or* `ch->mana -= mana;` (success) — never both, and never before the concentration roll. QuickMUD deducted the full `mana_cost` upfront, then an additional `mana_cost/2` on failure, so a failed cast cost 1.5× — a level-1 magic missile (cost 50) took 75 mana on failure (100→25) instead of 25 (100→75). Now the upfront deduction is removed: failure costs `mana_cost//2`, success costs the full `mana_cost`. Surfaced via in-game play ("magic missile costs 75 of 100 mana" was a failed cast over-deducting). Regression: `tests/integration/test_spell_casting.py::TestCastManaDeductionCAST008`.
- **TRAIN-002 — training a non-prime stat now costs 1 session, not 2.** ROM `src/act_move.c` `do_train` sets `cost = 1;` once before the stat dispatch; each `if (class_table[ch->class].attr_prime == STAT_X) cost = 1;` branch is a no-op and there is no `else cost = 2;`, so training any stat (or hp/mana) always costs exactly 1 training session. QuickMUD had invented `cost = 1 if prime else 2`, overcharging e.g. a mage training con/wis by double. Now `cost` is unconditionally 1 and the dead prime-stat map is removed. Surfaced via in-game play. Regression: `tests/integration/test_recall_train_commands.py::test_train_nonprime_stat_costs_one_session`; corrected `::test_train_int_increases_stat` which had asserted the cost=2 divergence.
- **NANNY-015 — new characters now start with 3 training sessions, not 18.** ROM `src/nanny.c:776-777` unconditionally sets `ch->train = 3` (and `ch->practice = 5`) in the `CON_READ_MOTD` level-0 block for every new PC, overwriting the `(40 - points + 1)/2` formula computed earlier at `nanny.c:684` (which never survives to play). QuickMUD's `CreationSelection.train_value()` ported only the dead formula, so an elf (race points = 5) was created with `(40-5+1)//2 = 18` training sessions; practice was correctly hardcoded to 5. Now `train_value()` returns 3. Surfaced via in-game play. Regression: `tests/integration/test_nanny_login_parity.py::test_new_character_starts_with_three_training_sessions`.
- **`INV-025` follow-up — `do_open` door `act(TO_ROOM)` now dispatches `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_open` (`src/act_move.c:436`) emits `"$n opens the $d."` through `act(..., TO_ROOM)` with no `MOBtrigger=FALSE` guard, so NPC recipients receive `mp_act_trigger` from `src/comm.c:2384-2385`. Python only broadcast the visible room line. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_do_open_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **`INV-025` follow-up — plague tick room `act()` lines now use per-recipient PERS masking and dispatch `TRIG_ACT`.** ROM `char_update` (`src/update.c:803-804`, `:836-837`) emits plague tick room messages through `act(..., TO_ROOM)`, so the actor is excluded, `$n` is rendered per listener via `PERS`, and NPC recipients receive `mp_act_trigger` from `src/comm.c:2384-2385`. Python baked `character.name` once through `_message_room`, echoing the TO_ROOM line back to the plagued character, leaking invisible actor names, and skipping ACT triggers. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_plague_tick_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.
- **GL-025 — `char_update` now matches ROM light/timer/condition ordering before affect damage.** ROM `src/update.c:721-862` decays worn PC lights, advances idle timers, and applies hunger/thirst/full/drunk conditions before affect expiry and plague/poison/incap/mortal damage. Python ran the affect tick first, so a lethal poison/plague tick could move a one-tick light into the corpse before burnout, skipping `--room->light`, burnout messages, and object extraction. Regression: `tests/test_game_loop.py::test_char_update_decays_light_before_lethal_poison_tick`.
- **INV-031 — PC death preserves group/follower relationships.** ROM `raw_kill` calls `extract_char(victim, IS_NPC(victim))`; `die_follower` is gated behind `fPull=TRUE` (NPCs only), so PC death does NOT dissolve group/follower relationships. Python was calling `die_follower(victim)` unconditionally, incorrectly dissolving the group when a PC leader died. Now `die_follower` is called only for NPC victims. Also fixed `is_same_group` in `mud/commands/group_commands.py` to use `is` (identity) instead of `==` (field equality), matching ROM's pointer comparison. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv031_pc_death_preserves_group.py` (4 tests).

### Added
- **INV-030 — `bless` Object branch (ROM `src/magic.c:788-834`).** `bless()` now handles Object targets: already-blessed rejection, evil-dispel branch (removes ITEM_EVIL via `affect_remove_obj` on success), clean-object affect application (TO_OBJECT / APPLY_SAVES / -1 / ITEM_BLESS via `affect_to_obj`), and `saving_throw -= 1` side effect for worn objects. Matches ROM `spell_bless` TARGET_OBJ branch byte-for-byte. `do_cast` already routes `defensive_character_or_object` Object targets through `get_obj_carry`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv030_bless_object_branch.py` (7 tests).

### Fixed
- **Test stabilization — `attack_round` RNG seed fix for `test_combat_death.py`.** After FIGHT-019 (ROM THAC0 hit model), `attack_round` uses `number_bits(5)` for the hit roll instead of the legacy `number_percent`. Eleven tests that called `attack_round` only patched `number_percent` and `number_range`, making the hit roll nondeterministic in xdist. Added `monkeypatch.setattr("mud.utils.rng_mm.number_bits", lambda bits: 19)` (ROM auto-hit) to all `attack_round`-using tests in `test_combat_death.py`, eliminating the flake.

### Fixed
- **CAST-007 — `do_cast` now enforces PK safety gates (`is_safe`/`is_safe_spell`, `check_killer`) and the AFF_CHARM master gate for offensive spell targets.** ROM `src/magic.c:395-413` (`TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE`) and `:481-495` (`TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF`) call `is_safe`/`is_safe_spell` and `check_killer` for non-NPC casters before the `AFF_CHARM` master gate; all three were missing from the Python `do_cast` path. Fixed: after target resolution and before mana deduction, (1) `is_safe`/`is_safe_spell` blocks the cast with "Not on that target." for PC casters targeting a safe room / shopkeeper / healer / etc. (self-target exemption mirrors ROM); (2) `check_killer` flags clan-member PCs as KILLER for attacking innocent PCs, and strips charm on charmed PCs whose resolved victim is a non-NPC (mirroring ROM `stop_follower` side effect); (3) the AFF_CHARM master gate blocks any caster from targeting their own master ("You can't do that on your own follower."). Object targets bypass all three gates per ROM. Defensive spells (`TAR_CHAR_DEFENSIVE` / `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF`) have no PK gates per ROM. Regression: `tests/integration/test_do_cast_pk_gates.py` (17 tests).

### Changed
- **Group-command lint cleanup (2.11.51).** Removed two stale unused imports from `mud/commands/group_commands.py` (`Position` and the inner `character_registry` import in `do_group`) so the module passes targeted Ruff checks without changing command behavior. Verification: `ruff check mud/commands/group_commands.py`; `pytest -n0 tests/integration/test_group_combat.py tests/integration/test_do_group_notification.py tests/integration/test_do_follow_master_notification.py tests/integration/test_act_comm_gaps.py -q`.

### Fixed
- **CAST-004/005/006 — `do_cast` now routes object targets (TAR_OBJ_INV, TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF, TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF).** Previously, `do_cast` could only resolve character targets; object-only spells (`identify`, `enchant armor`, `enchant weapon`, `fireproof`, `create water`, `detect poison`, `recharge`) fell through to `target = char`. Offensive object/char spells (`curse`, `poison`) and defensive object/char spells (`bless`, `invisibility`, `remove curse`) could not reach their object fallback. ROM `src/magic.c:449-536` has three distinct object-targeting paths now mirrored in Python: **TAR_OBJ_INV** validates a named target is present and resolves via `get_obj_carry` (error messages: "What should the spell be cast upon?" / "You are not carrying that."); **TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF** falls back to `get_obj_here` after character lookup fails; **TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF** falls back to `get_obj_carry` after character lookup fails (error: "You don't see that here."). Regression: `tests/integration/test_do_cast_object_target.py` (10/10).

### Fixed
- **`INV-025` follow-up — position-command room `act()` lines now dispatch `TRIG_ACT` to listening NPCs.** ROM `do_stand`/`do_rest`/`do_sit`/`do_sleep` (`src/act_move.c:999-1449`) emits room-visible position changes through `act(..., TO_ROOM)`, so `comm.c:2384` fires `mp_act_trigger` on NPC recipients. Python's shared `mud/commands/position.py:_broadcast` delivered those lines via `broadcast_room` only. It now calls `mp_act_trigger_room` after the broadcast, preserving delivery while matching ROM mobprog dispatch. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv025_mobprog_act_trigger_dispatch.py::test_position_act_room_broadcast_fires_act_trigger_on_listening_npc`.
- **`INV-001` wrong-channel cousin — shop haggle success lines now deliver immediately to connected players.** ROM `do_buy`/`do_sell` (`src/act_obj.c:2606-2607`, `:2728`, `:2929`) sends successful haggle text via `send_to_char` / `act(TO_CHAR)`. The pet-buy, item-buy, and sell branches appended those lines to `char.messages`, so connected PCs saw them late on mailbox drain. All three branches now use `push_message`, preserving disconnected mailbox fallback. Regression: `tests/integration/test_shop_haggle_delivery_channel.py` (3).
- **`INV-001` wrong-channel cousin — pet-shop `add_follower` now delivers `"$n now follows you."` immediately to connected buyers.** ROM `add_follower` (`src/act_comm.c:1602-1605`) uses `act()` for both the master and follower lines. The pet-shop path called the shared `mud/characters/follow.py:add_follower`, which appended `"companion pet now follows you."` to the buyer mailbox only; connected PCs saw it late on the next mailbox drain instead of via the live descriptor. `add_follower` now uses `push_message` for both TO_VICT/TO_CHAR legs, preserving mailbox fallback for disconnected characters and tests. Regression: `tests/integration/test_pet_buy_single_delivery.py` now asserts the follow line reaches the connection before mailbox drain.
- **`VISION-002` (dark-gate same-room divergence) — ✅ FIXED.** ROM `can_see` (`src/handler.c:2638`) checks `room_is_dark(ch->in_room)` unconditionally — no same-room guard. Python's dark gate had an extra `observer_room is target_room` conjunction that let a character in a dark room see targets in lit rooms (cross-room), diverging from ROM. Fixed by removing the same-room check so the dark gate fires on the observer's room alone. Test: `tests/integration/test_vision_002_dark_gate.py` (5).

## [2.13.17] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Diff-harness Phase C widening — full drink logic + pour into held container.**
  Added three new C-shim meta-commands: `__cond_full=<n>` (set PC fullness), `__cond_thirst=<n>` (set PC thirst), and `__mob_hold=<vnum>` (spawn empty drink container, equip to first NPC's HOLD slot). The `drink_bottle_beer` state-machine rule now injects `__cond_full=0` before the drink command so the actual drinking path (sip decrement, condition gains, liquid effects) is exercised against the C oracle instead of just the fullness guard. Added `give_drunk_empty_cup` and `pour_bottle_into_drunk_held_cup` rules exercising the vch branch of ROM `do_pour` (`src/act_obj.c:1146-1157`): player pours beer from their bottle into a coffee cup held by the drunk mob. One new live C-oracle test (`test_generated_pour_into_held_container_matches_live_c`).

### Fixed

- **Diff-harness snapshot inventory filter.** `pysnap._char_snap` now calls the new `_is_equipped` helper to exclude equipped items from the `inventory` list, matching the C shim's `obj->wear_loc != WEAR_NONE` gate (`src/diff_shim/diffmain.c:292-293`). Previously equipped items appeared in both `inventory` and `equipment`, diverging from the C snapshot and surfacing in the pour-into-held test.

## [2.13.16] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Diff-harness Phase C widening — pour between containers.** The
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now covers `pour <source> <target>` (transfer
  liquid between two drink containers). Added coffee cup object (vnum 3101,
  keywords ``coffee cup``) with load/get/pour-out/pour-between rules. The live
  C-oracle test pours beer from a bottle (vnum 3001, 16 sips) into an empty
  coffee cup (capacity 6), exercising the full `do_pour` transfer path: liquid
  type guard (skipped for empty target), amount transfer (min(16, 6) = 6 sips),
  and liquid type copy from source to target. One new live C-oracle test
  (`test_generated_pour_between_containers_matches_live_c`).

## [2.13.15] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Diff-harness Phase C widening — pour out + fill from fountain.** The
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now covers `pour <container> out` (empies a
  drink container, clears poison flag) and `fill <container>` (fills from a
  fountain to max capacity). Movement rules to room 3005 (The Sanctuary,
  south of the temple) and a fountain spawn rule (`__oload=3135`) support
  the fill path. `_ObjectState` gained `poured_out` tracking. Two new live
  C-oracle tests lock the pour-out and fill-from-fountain pipelines.

### Fixed

- **`generated.py` duplicate object definitions removed (2nd pass).** The
  earlier cleanup missed some silently-overwriting `_ObjectState` assignments;
  fully cleaned now.

## [2.13.14] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Diff-harness Phase C widening — mob `__mload` + `give` objects/gold/silver.**
  The `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now includes a `_MobState` model (drunk, vnum
  3064) with `load_drunk`, `give_sword_to_drunk`, `give_gold_to_drunk`, and
  `give_silver_to_drunk` rules. Meta-commands `__silver=200` and `__gold=10` are
  prepended to the generated scenario steps so give transfers have source funds.
  Mob names are auto-added to `watch_chars` for snapshot comparison. The live
  C-oracle test `test_generated_mob_give_matches_live_c` verifies the full
  `__mload` → object give → gold give → silver give pipeline (gold/silver purse
  + sword-inventory transfer).
- **Diff-harness Phase C widening — drink container `do_drink` + position
  transitions `rest`/`sleep`/`wake`/`stand`.** The
  `DeterministicNoRngDiffMachine` now covers a bottle of beer (vnum 3001,
  `ITEM_DRINK_CON`) with `load_bottle_beer`, `get_bottle_beer`, and
  `drink_bottle_beer` rules, plus position transition rules (`rest`, `sleep`,
  `wake`, `stand`) that exercise the `Position` enum path from STANDING through
  RESTING and SLEEPING and back. The default test character starts at
  `condition[FULL]=48` (>45), so the drink rule exercises the fullness guard
  (both C and Python block with the same message). Two new live C-oracle tests
  lock both surfaces.
- **`__cond_full` / `__cond_thirst` meta-commands in pyreplay.py.** The Python
  replay driver can now set character condition slots via `__cond_full=N` /
  `__cond_thirst=N`, mirroring the `__gold`/`__silver` meta-command pattern.
  These are Python-only (the C shim does not yet support them).

### Fixed

- **GIVE-013 — `do_give` → `MobInstance` crash.** `do_give` called
  `victim.add_object(obj)` but `MobInstance` lacks that method (only `Character`
  has `add_object`). ROM's `obj_to_char(obj, victim)` works on any `CHAR_DATA *`
  pointer (PC or NPC). Fixed by routing through the universal
  `_obj_to_char(obj, victim)` in `mud/game_loop.py`, which dispatches to
  `Character.add_object` or `MobInstance.add_to_inventory` as appropriate.
- **Room people list ordering now matches ROM LIFO.** ROM `char_to_room`
  (`src/handler.c:1497-1503`) head-inserts into `pRoomIndex->people`, so the
  most-recently-arrived occupant is listed first. Python's `Room.add_character`
  was using `append` (FIFO), which reversed the `look` output order. Fixed to
  `insert(0, char)`, matching the INV-039 head-insert convention already applied
  to objects. Surfaced by the Hypothesis state machine's new mob rules.
- **`generated.py` duplicate object definitions removed.** A prior session edit
  left duplicate `_ObjectState` assignments for `scale_jacket`, `torch`,
  `bread`, and `bag` — the later copies overwrote the earlier ones silently.
  Cleaned up.

## [2.11.44]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-032` (defense TO_CHAR/TO_VICT PERS masking) — ✅ FIXED.** ROM `check_parry`/`check_shield_block`/`check_dodge` (`src/fight.c:1317-1370`) deliver their lines via `act("$N parries your attack.", ch, NULL, victim, TO_CHAR)` / `act("You parry $n's attack.", ..., TO_VICT)`, where `$n`/`$N` resolve through `PERS(ch/victim, looker)`. An invisible actor renders as "someone"; an NPC renders its `short_descr`. Python used `getattr(x, "name", "Something")` f-strings — no `can_see` masking and no `short_descr` for NPCs. Fixed by routing all six defense messages through `pers()` per recipient (matching `_broadcast_pos_change` / `render_for` pattern). Cross-ref INV-027. Test: `tests/integration/test_fight_032_defense_pers.py` (7 — parry invisible attacker/defender/NPC, shield_block invisible attacker/defender, dodge invisible attacker/defender).
- **`FIGHT-033` (WEAPON_FROST/SHOCKING victim lines drop `$p` weapon name) — ✅ FIXED.** ROM renders the TO_CHAR victim line with the weapon: FROST `act("The cold touch of $p surrounds you with ice.", ...)` (`src/fight.c:664`), SHOCKING `act("You are shocked by $p.", ...)` (`:675`). Python emitted `"The cold touch surrounds you with ice."` (missing `$p`) and `"You are shocked by the weapon."` (generic instead of `$p`). Fixed by threading `weapon_name` into both TO_CHAR templates, matching ROM's `$p` substitution. Test: `tests/integration/test_fight_033_frost_shocking_weapon_name.py` (2).
- **`FIGHT-034` (auto-split per-member line not capitalized + bypasses PERS) — ✅ FIXED.** ROM `do_split` (`src/act_comm.c:1946-1962`) delivers the per-member share line via `act("$n splits %d silver coins. Your share is %d silver.", ch, NULL, gch, TO_VICT)`. Python `_auto_split` and `do_split` built f-strings with `char.name` (no `can_see` masking) and no capitalize. Fixed by routing both sites through `pers(actor, member)` per recipient + `capitalize_act_line`, matching ROM `act(TO_VICT)`. Cross-ref INV-029, INV-027. Test: `tests/integration/test_fight_034_auto_split_pers_cap.py` (5).

## [2.11.43]

### Fixed
- **`ACT-CAP-003` (do_say / do_tell / do_shout / do_yell / do_emote capitalization) — ✅ FIXED; INV-029 cousin for the communication surface.** ROM `act_new` caps the first visible letter of every `act()` line. `do_say`/`do_tell`/`do_shout`/`do_yell`/`do_emote` build per-listener f-strings that bypassed `capitalize_act_line`. Fixed by applying `capitalize_act_line` to all six output sites (do_say per-listener + TO_CHAR, `_handle_buffered_tell` TO_VICT + do_tell TO_CHAR, do_shout per-listener + TO_CHAR, do_yell per-listener + TO_CHAR, do_emote per-listener + TO_CHAR). TELL-006 (buffered tell cap) closed. Re-baselined 4 stale lowercase assertions. Test: `tests/integration/test_act_cap_003_communication_capitalize.py` (6).
- **`ACT-CAP-004` (broadcast_global channel capitalization) — ✅ FIXED; the final INV-029 cousin.** All nine `broadcast_global` channel callers (auction, gossip, grats, quote, question, answer, music, clan, immtalk) route through ROM `act_new()` which caps. Each now applies `capitalize_act_line` to both the `broadcast_global` message and the TO_CHAR return. Weather messages remain uncapped (matching ROM `send_to_char`). Test: `tests/integration/test_act_cap_004_broadcast_global_capitalize.py` (6). With ACT-CAP-001/002/003/004, INV-029's `act_new` first-letter-cap is enforced across all delivery surfaces.

## [2.11.42]

### Fixed
- **`ACT-CAP-003` (communication command capitalization — do_say, do_tell, do_reply, do_shout, do_yell, do_emote) — ✅ FIXED; closes the INV-029 cousin for the `mud/commands/communication.py` surface.** ROM `act_new` (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`) upper-cases the first visible letter of every `act()` line (with the `{`-colour-code kludge). `do_say`/`do_tell`/`do_shout`/`do_yell`/`do_emote` build per-listener f-strings that bypassed `capitalize_act_line`, so an invisible speaker's `"someone says…"` rendered lowercase where ROM renders `"Someone says…"`. Fixed by applying `capitalize_act_line` at all six output sites: `do_say` per-listener + TO_CHAR, `_handle_buffered_tell` (TO_VICT for all three paths — live/AFK/linkdead) + `do_tell` TO_CHAR, `do_shout` per-listener + TO_CHAR, `do_yell` per-listener + TO_CHAR, `do_emote` per-listener + TO_CHAR. PERS (`pers()`) rendering unchanged — only the capitalization layer added. TELL-006 (buffered tell cap) closed. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_cap_003_communication_capitalize.py` (6 — say visible + invisible, tell visible + invisible, reply, shout). Re-baselined 4 stale lowercase assertions (`test_tell_parity`, `test_say_parity`, `test_shout_yell_parity`, `test_emote_parity` — "someone" → "Someone"). Full suite 5024 passed / 0 failed. **Remaining open:** `broadcast_global` (per-channel treatment needed — mixed: channels are `act()`, weather is `send_to_char`). See `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md` ACT-CAP-003 and `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-029.

## [2.11.41]

### Fixed
- **`ACT-CAP-002` (Room.broadcast + _message_room + TO_ALL caster legs) — ✅ FIXED; closes the parallel room-broadcast half of INV-029.** Three uncapped `act()`-equivalent delivery surfaces left by ACT-CAP-001 (`broadcast_room`): **(a)** `mud/models/room.py:Room.broadcast` — the ~20-caller `act(TO_ROOM)`-equivalent terminal delivery primitive, now caps at entry via `capitalize_act_line` (same pattern as `broadcast_room`). **(b)** `mud/game_loop.py:_message_room` — the object wear-off room broadcast (`$p fades into view.` etc.), now caps at entry; the delegation to `Room.broadcast` gets a double-cap, but `capitalize_act_line` is idempotent on already-capped text. **(c)** the **TO_ALL caster legs** in object-spell handlers: ROM `act("$p fades out of sight.", …, TO_ALL)` caps for everyone including the caster, but the Python handlers split into `_send_to_char(caster, message)` (uncapped) + `broadcast_room(room, message, exclude=caster)` (capped), producing a lowercase caster leg. Fixed by capping the shared `message` at each build site (`invis`, `poison`, `remove_curse`, `continual_light` object-glow, `create_food`) so both legs match ROM `act(..., TO_ALL)`. **`broadcast_global` is still NOT capped** — it is mixed (channels are `act()`, ROM weather is `send_to_char`); needs per-channel treatment. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_cap_002_room_broadcast.py` (8 — Room.broadcast × 4 + _message_room × 2 + invis caster + remove_curse caster). Full-suite sweep re-baselined 8 stale lowercase assertions (`test_skills_buffs` invis ×2 + wear-off, `test_skills_debuffs` poison, `test_skills_conjuration` mushroom + continual-light, `test_skills_healing` remove_curse, `test_spell_creation_rom_parity` mushroom + continual-light, `test_game_loop` torch-out + corpse-decay + container-spill). Full suite 5014 passed / 0 failed. See `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md` ACT-CAP-002 and `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-029.

## [2.11.40]

### Fixed
- **`ACT-CAP-001` (broadcast_room half) — ✅ FIXED; the room-broadcast cousin of INV-029.** ROM delivers room broadcasts via `act(..., TO_ROOM)` (movement "$n leaves $T." `src/act_move.c:197`, doors "$n opens $p." `:384`, wear/drop/get, spell room lines, …) and `act_new` (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`) upper-cases the first visible char of every such line (with the `{`-colour-code kludge → cap `buf[2]`). `mud/net/protocol.py:broadcast_room` is the Python `act(TO_ROOM)` delivery boundary for ~64 command/skill/movement callers, but delivered the caller's baked string verbatim — so an NPC- or object-led line (e.g. `"the goblin arrives."`, `"a healer utters the words 'energizer'."`, `"a shimmering portal rises up from the ground."`, `"cursed sword glows blue."`) reached players uncapped. Fixed by capping the message **once at `broadcast_room` function entry** via the shared `mud/utils/act.py:capitalize_act_line` — `broadcast_room` is a *terminal* delivery primitive (its argument IS the delivered line, one baked string for all recipients), so the cap is applied once, not per-recipient (idempotent on already-capped callers). **`broadcast_global` is deliberately NOT capped** — it is mixed (channels are `act()`, but ROM weather is `send_to_char`, `src/update.c weather_update`); it needs per-channel treatment, filed as the ACT-CAP-001 remainder. `gitnexus_impact(broadcast_room)` = CRITICAL (64 direct callers, **0 affected processes**) — expected, the deliberate render-behaviour change identical to INV-029/FIGHT-031; the blast radius is a test-assertion sweep. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_cap_001_broadcast_room.py` (3 — plain line + `{`-kludge + already-capital no-op, asserting the cap *property* not the rendered name, since `broadcast_room` does no PERS masking). Full-suite sweep re-baselined **9** stale lowercase room-leg asserts (`test_skills_buffs` invis ×2 + fireproof, `test_skills_debuffs` poison-weapon + poison-food, `test_skills_transport` portal + nexus, `test_skills_healing` remove_curse, `test_healer_command_parity` healer utterance) to their ROM-correct capitalized forms. Full suite 5010 passed / 0 failed. Surfaced + filed durably as **`ACT-CAP-002`** (`docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md`): three parallel uncapped room-broadcast siblings — `mud/models/room.py:Room.broadcast` (~20 callers), `mud/game_loop.py:_message_room` (object wear-off), and the **TO_ALL caster legs** in the object-spell handlers (ROM `act("$p …", TO_ALL)` caps the caster too, but the Python `_send_to_char(caster, message)` leg is uncapped — so the re-baselined tests assert caster-lowercase / witness-capitalized per spell, with comments). See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-029 and `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md` ACT-CAP-001/002.

## [2.11.39]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-031` (combat act() capitalization) — ✅ FIXED; closes the combat half of INV-029 / ACT-CAP-001.** ROM `act_new` upper-cases the first visible char of **every** rendered `act()` line (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`, with the `{`-colour-code kludge → cap `buf[2]`). FIGHT-025 (2.11.14) capped only the combat `dam_message` render chokepoint (`mud/combat/messages.py:render_for`); the other two combat act() render paths stayed uncapped: **(a)** `mud/combat/engine.py:_broadcast_pos_change` — the per-listener PERS render for the position-change room broadcasts (`src/fight.c:837-861` mortal / incap / stunned / DEAD) and all five weapon-special room broadcasts (poison/vampiric/flaming/frost/shocking, `src/fight.c:614,643,654,663,673`); **(b)** the direct-f-string `_push_message` defense TO_CHAR lines (`check_parry` `src/fight.c:1318`, `check_shield_block` `:1345`, `check_dodge` `:1370`) and the flaming victim line (`:655` `act("$p sears your flesh.", …)`). So a dying NPC rendered `"{Rthe orc is DEAD!!{x"` where ROM's kludge caps `buf[2]` → `"{RThe orc is DEAD!!{x"`, and an NPC defender rendered `"the guard parries your attack."` where ROM caps `"The guard parries your attack."`. Fixed by capping each per-listener line + the `canonical` fed to `mp_act_trigger_room` inside `_broadcast_pos_change` (ROM caps `buf` at `:2376` **before** the TRIG_ACT dispatch at `:2384`), and wrapping the four direct-f-string sites in the shared `mud/utils/act.py:capitalize_act_line`. The POISON victim line (`src/fight.c:612`) is `send_to_char`, **not** `act()`, so it is correctly left uncapped — each site was verified `act()` vs `send_to_char` against `src/fight.c:595-682` before capping. `gitnexus_impact` on `_broadcast_pos_change` = CRITICAL (27 impacted, 3 direct callers, 0 processes) — expected, the deliberate render-behaviour change identical to INV-029's `act_format` impact; the blast radius is a test-assertion sweep. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_031_combat_act_capitalization.py` (5 — chokepoint room line + DEAD `{R`-kludge + parry/dodge/shield-block, asserting the cap *property* not the rendered name so the FIGHT-032 PERS fix won't break them). Full-suite sweep re-baselined 3 stale lowercase asserts (`tests/test_weapon_special_attacks.py` flaming ×2 `"test weapon"`→`"Test weapon"`; `tests/integration/test_invisibility_combat.py` FIGHT-007 `"someone is DEAD!!"`→`"Someone is DEAD!!"` — the INV-027 mask + INV-029 cap composing into the ROM-correct `{RSomeone is DEAD!!{x`). Full suite 5007 passed / 0 failed. Surfaced two out-of-scope divergences, filed durably in `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md` Follow-ups: **`FIGHT-032`** (the defense lines render the defender's name from the raw `name` field, not ROM `$N`→PERS — no can_see masking; INV-027 family) and **`FIGHT-033`** (the FROST/SHOCKING victim lines drop the `$p` weapon name). The remaining INV-029 / ACT-CAP-001 cousins (`do_say`/`do_tell`, `mud/net/protocol.py:broadcast_room`/`broadcast_global`) stay OPEN. See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-029 and `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md` FIGHT-031.

## [2.11.38]

### Fixed
- **`INV-029` (ACT-FIRST-LETTER-CAP) — ✅ ENFORCED.** ROM `act_new` upper-cases the first visible letter of **every** rendered `act()` line before delivery (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`), with a kludge for a leading `{` colour code (`buf[0]=='{'` → cap `buf[2]`, the char after the 2-char `{X` code; else `buf[0]`; `UPPER` flips ASCII `a`–`z` only). The Python act-family did not, so a masked `$n`/`$N` rendering `"someone"` at a sentence start showed `"someone …"` instead of ROM's `"Someone …"`, and any lowercase-led act line (e.g. `$p` object short_descrs like `"a sword dissolves…"`, mob short_descrs like `"a nasty assassin…"`, the jukebox `"the jukebox starts playing…"`) was never capitalized. This is the natural completion of INV-027 (ACT-PERS-NAME-MASKING). Closed via a shared `mud/utils/act.py:capitalize_act_line` helper (replicating the `{`-kludge + ASCII-only UPPER) applied at the two render boundaries the port uses: **(a)** `mud/utils/act.py:act_format`'s return — the ~113-call-site `act_new` equivalent (a gating check confirmed the only result interpolated mid-string, the music `f"{prefix} {suffix}"`, is sentence-start, so capping is correct); **(b)** the `mud/commands/imm_commands.py` `pers()`-built f-strings that bypass `act_format` (`do_force` ×4, `do_transfer`, `_act_room`, `_act_room_invis_gated`). `gitnexus_impact` on `act_format` = CRITICAL (43 direct callers) — expected, since this deliberately changes the first letter of every act line; the "blast radius" was a 15-assertion test sweep flipping now-stale lowercase expectations to their ROM-correct capitalized form (incl. the WIZ-047/048/049 `"someone"` → `"Someone"` lockstep that those tests asserted lowercase deliberately). Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv029_act_first_letter_cap.py` (7 tests: helper `{`-kludge / ASCII-only / empty-short edge cases + `act_format` plain/masked-name + `do_force` masked-name). Full suite 5002 passed / 0 failed. **Tracked cousins (still uncapped — direct-f-string `act()` sites that bypass `act_format`, to be closed each with its own failing-first test):** `do_say` / `do_tell` (`mud/commands/communication.py` build `"{6$n says…"` / `"{k$n tells you…"`) and the combat damage messages (`mud/combat/messages.py` / `engine.py`); plus the wiznet `WIZ_PREFIX` `"{Z--> "` path (Python caps the inner message vs ROM capping `buf[2]`=`-`, a no-op — prefix-on case only, unexercised). See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-029 and `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md`.

## [2.11.37]

### Fixed
- **`WIZ-049` — `do_force` leaked the forcing immortal's name to forced victims across all four branches; the third (and final) PERS-leak sibling in the `do_transfer`/`do_force` family.** ROM `do_force` (`src/act_wiz.c:4205`) builds `sprintf(buf, "$n forces you to '%s'.", argument)` and delivers it via `act(buf, ch, NULL, vch, TO_VICT)` at `:4228` (force all), `:4251` (force players), `:4274` (force gods), `:4316` (single target) — `$n` is the **forcer** (`ch`), rendered through `PERS(ch, vch)` → `"someone forces you to '<cmd>'."` when the victim cannot `can_see` the (invisible / wiz-invis) immortal. Python (`mud/commands/imm_commands.py:do_force`) used the raw name unconditionally at all four sites, leaking a wiz-invis immortal's identity to every forced victim. Now each site renders `$n` per-recipient via `mud/world/vision.py:pers(char, vch)` (single-target: `pers(char, victim)`) — the same helper the WIZ-047/048 and `act_format._pers` enforcements use. `gitnexus_impact` = LOW. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py::test_force_masks_invisible_immortal_name_for_nonseeing_victim` + `::test_force_shows_immortal_name_to_seeing_victim` (single-target branch; the all/players/gods branches share the identical `pers(char, vch)` call). **With WIZ-049 closed, the INV-027 (ACT-PERS-NAME-MASKING) contract is fully enforced** across `act_format`, `_act_room` (TO_ROOM), `do_transfer` (TO_VICT), and `do_force` (TO_VICT) — no known PERS-leak sites remain. The only open INV-027-adjacent item is the cross-cutting **ACT-FIRST-LETTER-CAP** divergence (ROM `act()` upper-cases `buf[0]`, `src/comm.c:2376-2379`, so the masked render is `"Someone …"`; the Python act-family does not — filed to become INV-028; the WIZ-047/048/049 tests assert lowercase `"someone"` and move in lockstep when it is closed). See `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md` (WIZ-049 ✅ FIXED) and `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-027.

## [2.11.36]

### Fixed
- **`WIZ-048` — `do_transfer` leaked the transferring immortal's name to the moved victim, the TO_VICT sibling of WIZ-047.** After moving the victim, ROM `do_transfer` (`src/act_wiz.c:874-875`) notifies it via `act("$n has transferred you.", ch, NULL, victim, TO_VICT)` — `$n` is the **immortal** (`ch`), rendered through `PERS(ch, victim)` → `"someone has transferred you."` when the victim cannot `can_see` the (invisible / wiz-invis) immortal. Python (`mud/commands/imm_commands.py:282-290`) used the immortal's real name unconditionally, leaking a wiz-invis immortal's identity to every transferred victim. Now the notify line renders `$n` per-recipient via `mud/world/vision.py:pers(char, victim)` (the same helper the WIZ-047 / `act_format._pers` enforcement uses). Distinct from WIZ-047 (TO_ROOM mushroom-cloud/puff-of-smoke, `$n`=victim); this is the TO_VICT notify, `$n`=ch. `gitnexus_impact` = LOW (`do_transfer` only reachable via `do_teleport`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py::test_transfer_masks_invisible_immortal_name_for_nonseeing_victim` + `::test_transfer_shows_immortal_name_to_seeing_victim`. While closing this, a **third** sibling in the same family surfaced and is filed OPEN as **WIZ-049**: `do_force`'s four TO_VICT `"$n forces you to '<cmd>'."` lines (`src/act_wiz.c:4205,4228,4251,4274,4316`, `$n`=the forcer) likewise render the raw name (`imm_commands.py:327,342,357,387`), leaking a wiz-invis immortal's identity to forced victims. Also noted: ROM `act()` upper-cases the first letter of every rendered line (`src/comm.c:2376-2379`), so the true ROM render is `"Someone …"` (capital S); the Python act-family does not replicate this `buf[0]` capitalization — a cross-cutting divergence (ACT-FIRST-LETTER-CAP) filed in `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md`, to be promoted to INV-028. The WIZ-047/048 tests assert lowercase `"someone"` to match current behavior and move in lockstep when that is closed. See `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md` (WIZ-048 ✅ FIXED, WIZ-049 ❌ OPEN) and `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-027.

## [2.11.35]

### Fixed
- **`WIZ-047` — `imm_commands._act_room` leaked an invisible/wiz-invis transferred immortal's name to non-seeing witnesses (`do_transfer`); the remaining `_act_room` half of the INV-027 PERS contract.** ROM `do_transfer` (`src/act_wiz.c:870,873`) announces the mushroom-cloud / puff-of-smoke lines via `act("$n ...", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)`, so `$n` (the transferred victim) is rendered per-recipient through `PERS(victim, witness)` → `"someone"` for any witness who cannot `can_see` the (invisible / wiz-invis) victim — the line is still delivered, only the name is masked. Python's `mud/commands/imm_commands.py:_act_room` did `message.replace("$n", char.name)` once and sent the same string to every occupant, with no PERS masking. Now `_act_room` renders `$n` per-recipient via `mud/world/vision.py:pers(char, person)` (the same helper the 2.11.34 `act_format._pers` enforcement and the combat path use), masking to `"someone"` for non-seeing witnesses while still delivering the line; the actor is skipped (ROM `act()` TO_ROOM does not echo to the subject). Distinct from WIZ-045/046, which gate the *whole* bamf line on `invis_level` for `do_goto`/`do_violate` via `_act_room_invis_gated` (already correct). `gitnexus_impact` = LOW (1 direct caller `do_transfer`, transitive `do_teleport`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_wiz047_transfer_pers_name_masking.py` (non-seeing witness → `"someone arrives..."`, seeing witness → real name; visible-subject regression guard). While closing this, a sibling TO_VICT leak surfaced and is filed as **WIZ-048** (OPEN): `do_transfer`'s `"$n has transferred you."` (`src/act_wiz.c:874-875`, `$n` = the immortal) is sent with the immortal's real name unconditionally (`imm_commands.py:282-285`), leaking a wiz-invis immortal's identity to the transferred victim. See `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md` (WIZ-047 ✅ FIXED, WIZ-048 ❌ OPEN) and `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-027.

## [2.11.34]

### Fixed
- **`INV-027` (ACT-PERS-NAME-MASKING) — ✅ ENFORCED (per-recipient subset).** ROM `act()` `$n`/`$N` substitutions mask an unseen actor's name to `"someone"` via `PERS`→`can_see` (`src/merc.h:2145`, `src/handler.c:2618-2664`) — for both generic `act(TO_ROOM)` and wiznet (`src/act_wiz.c:188` passes the actor as `vch`). `mud/utils/act.py:act_format._pers` returned the name unconditionally, leaking an invisible/wiz-invis/unseen actor's identity to recipients who cannot see them (only the combat path via `mud/world/vision.py:pers` was faithful). With the VISION-001 prerequisite in place (2.11.33), `_pers` now routes `$n`/`$N` through `can_see_character` when there is a concrete `viewer` (and `target is not viewer`), returning `"someone"` on failure. The broadcast-once `recipient=None` path keeps the name — it has no per-recipient viewer to gate against (the `docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md` architectural divergence; pinned by a boundary test). `announce_wiznet_new_player` (`mud/net/connection.py`) now builds a **real roomless `Character`** as the newbie-alert subject instead of a bare `SimpleNamespace`, so `$N` renders the real name via VISION-001 (ROM `nanny.c:547` passes the real roomless `ch`) and the visibility reads don't raise. Mock recipients in `test_wiznet`/`test_account_auth`/`test_spec_funs` were upgraded to roomed / `has_affect`-bearing doubles to match production (real roomed immortals) — expected strings unchanged. The `xfail` on `test_act_pers_masks_invisible_actor_name_for_nonseeing_recipient` is removed (now passing). Full suite: 4989 passed, 4 skipped, 0 xfailed. The enforcement is scoped to the per-recipient `act_format` path; the sibling `imm_commands._act_room` `$n` leak (`do_transfer` renders `$n` unconditionally, leaking an invisible/wiz-invis immortal's name) is **not** covered and is filed as a durable OPEN gap **WIZ-047** (`docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md`). See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-027 "Enforcement outcome (2026-05-29)".

- **`VISION-001` — `can_see_character` masked any roomless *target*, diverging from ROM `can_see` and blocking INV-027.** ROM `can_see` (`src/handler.c:2618-2664`) only ever dereferences the **looker's** room (`room_is_dark(ch->in_room)` and the incog comparison `ch->in_room != victim->in_room`); it **never** NULL-checks `victim->in_room`. Python's `can_see_character` (`mud/world/vision.py`) carried a non-ROM `target_room is None → False` bail that over-masked the legitimate roomless-subject case — the new player passed to `wiznet("Newbie alert! $N sighted.", ...)` (`src/nanny.c:547`), whose `in_room` is NULL at `CON_GET_NEW_CLASS`. **Fix:** drop the `target_room is None` bail; keep `observer_room is None → False` (defensive — ROM's looker always has a room, and the dark gate dereferences `ch->in_room`). A 28-direct-caller census (CRITICAL blast radius) confirmed no descriptor/registry/`room.people` iterator can observe a roomless target except the intentional synthetic wiznet subjects: `do_who` iterates `SESSIONS` (roomed by construction — room set at `connection.py:1879` before `SESSIONS` registration at `:1903`); `do_where`/`do_whois` carry their own room / `CON_PLAYING` guards; room transitions are synchronous (no `await` between `room=None` and re-placement/extract). No mortal-facing behavior change (the only newly-visible targets are the roomless wiznet subjects, which INV-027 enforcement will route through this gate). Unblocks INV-027 (ACT-PERS-NAME-MASKING). Regression: `tests/test_vision_roomless_target.py` (roomed observer in a LIT room sees a roomless non-invisible target; still masks an invisible roomless target without detect-invis; roomless observer still cannot see). The deferred dark-gate same-room divergence is filed as **VISION-002** (OPEN). See `docs/parity/HANDLER_C_AUDIT.md` "Stable-ID Divergences — `can_see()`".

## [2.11.32]

### Changed
- **`INV-027` (ACT-PERS-NAME-MASKING) probed — violation confirmed, enforcement attempted + reverted, blocker pinned.** ROM `act()` `$n`/`$N` substitutions mask an unseen actor's name to `"someone"` via `PERS`→`can_see` (`src/merc.h:2145`, `src/handler.c:2618-2664`) — confirmed for both generic `act(TO_ROOM)` and wiznet (`src/act_wiz.c:188` passes the actor as `vch`). `mud/utils/act.py:act_format._pers` lacks that gate (only the combat path via `mud/world/vision.py:pers` is faithful). The obvious fix — route `_pers` through `can_see_character` gated on `viewer is not None` — was implemented and **reverted**: it regresses 15 tests including real production wiznet paths (`announce_wiznet_new_player` passes a roomless `SimpleNamespace` placeholder, so `can_see_character`'s `room is None → False` bail renders **"Newbie alert! someone sighted."** / **"someone groks the fullness of his link."**). ROM `can_see` has no `victim->in_room` check, so enforcement is **blocked** on a separate `can_see_character` room-None reconciliation (its own gap: 43 `act_format` callers + combat depend on the helper). The same-room masking contract is now locked as a **strict `xfail`** in `tests/integration/test_inv027_act_pers_name_masking.py` (plus a passing `recipient=None` boundary guard); `_pers` carries an INV-027 NOTE. No production behavior change in this release. See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-027 "Probe outcome (2026-05-29)".

## [2.11.31]

### Fixed
- **`WIZ-046` — `do_violate` showed a wiz-invis immortal's bamf departure/arrival (swirling-mist) line to *every* witness, the same identity-leak as WIZ-045.** ROM `do_violate` (`src/act_wiz.c:1026-1051`) is structurally identical to `do_goto`: it loops `ch->in_room->people` and sends each bamfout/bamfin (or default swirling-mist) line via `act(..., rch, TO_VICT)` **only** to occupants where `get_trust(rch) >= ch->invis_level`, so a wiz-invis immortal's departure/arrival is **suppressed entirely** for sub-trust witnesses. The Python `do_violate` (`mud/commands/imm_server.py`) routed its four bamf broadcasts through the ungated `_act_room`, leaking the line — and thus the immortal's presence — to all witnesses. Now `do_violate` reuses the `_act_room_invis_gated` helper introduced for WIZ-045 (per-recipient `get_trust(person) >= char.invis_level` gate; the `_act_room` import was swapped). With `invis_level == 0` (normal immortal) the gate is always true, so the announce reaches everyone exactly as before. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py::test_violate_suppresses_bamf_for_subtrust_witnesses_when_wizinvis` (wiz-invis → high-trust witness sees the line, sub-trust witness sees nothing) + `::test_violate_bamf_visible_to_all_when_not_wizinvis` (regression guard for `invis_level == 0`). Closes the open follow-up filed with WIZ-045. See `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md:WIZ-046`.

## [2.11.30]

### Fixed
- **`WIZ-045` — `do_goto` showed a wiz-invis immortal's bamf departure/arrival (swirling-mist) line to *every* witness, leaking their identity and presence to sub-trust mortals.** ROM `do_goto` (`src/act_wiz.c:969-994`) does **not** broadcast the bamfout/bamfin (or default swirling-mist) line with a plain `act(..., TO_ROOM)`. It loops `ch->in_room->people` and sends each line via `act(..., rch, TO_VICT)` **only** to occupants where `get_trust(rch) >= ch->invis_level`, so a wiz-invis immortal's departure/arrival is **suppressed entirely** for sub-trust witnesses (gated on `invis_level` only, not full `can_see`). The Python `do_goto` (`mud/commands/imm_commands.py`) routed both bamf broadcasts through `_act_room`, which substitutes `$n`→`char.name` once and sends the same string to all room occupants — no `invis_level` gate. A new `_act_room_invis_gated` helper applies the per-recipient `get_trust(person) >= char.invis_level` gate (mirroring ROM); `do_goto`'s four bamf calls now use it. With `invis_level == 0` (normal immortal) the gate is always true, so the announce reaches everyone exactly as before. The shared `_act_room` (used by `do_transfer`, whose ROM path is a plain `act(TO_ROOM)` with PERS name-masking, no `invis_level` gate) is left untouched. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py::test_goto_suppresses_bamf_for_subtrust_witnesses_when_wizinvis` (wiz-invis → high-trust witness sees the line, sub-trust witness sees nothing) + `::test_goto_bamf_visible_to_all_when_not_wizinvis` (regression guard for `invis_level == 0`). Surfaced 2026-05-29 while correcting the INV-027 candidate in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, whose stated ROM mechanism (`act()` filters every recipient by trust) was wrong — the gate is per-command in `do_goto`/`do_violate`, not inside `act()`. The identical leak in `do_violate` (same `_act_room` root cause) is filed as **WIZ-046** (open follow-up). See `docs/parity/ACT_WIZ_C_AUDIT.md:WIZ-045`.

## [2.11.29]

### Fixed
- **`INV-001 (e)` — buying a pet double-delivered `"Enjoy your pet."` to a connected PC (SINGLE-DELIVERY family).** `do_buy`'s pet-shop branch (`mud/commands/shop.py:_handle_pet_shop_purchase`) did `char.messages.append("Enjoy your pet.")` **and** returned the same line. The connection read loop (`mud/net/connection.py:1980-2000`) sends a command's return value AND drains `char.messages`, so a connected PC buying a pet saw the line **twice** — the same INV-001 shape fixed for `do_kill` (FIGHT-020), `do_surrender`, `do_rescue` (FIGHT-029), and the "still recovering" sweep (INV-001 (d)). ROM `do_buy` (`src/act_obj.c:2635`) does `send_to_char("Enjoy your pet.\n\r", ch)` once and returns void. Fixed by dropping the mailbox append and keeping the return (the single canonical delivery). Regression: `tests/integration/test_pet_buy_single_delivery.py` (behavioral connected-PC single-delivery through `do_buy`); `tests/test_shops.py:test_pet_shop_purchase_creates_charmed_pet` realigned (the line is return-only now, no longer in the mailbox). Surfaced 2026-05-29 by the advisor while closing SHOP-PET-002, which rewrote this function. The haggle (`"You haggle the price down to N coins."`) and follow (`"… now follows you."`) lines remain mailbox-only — a lesser wrong-channel cousin noted in the tracker, not part of this fix (the haggle wrong-channel also spans the item-buy/sell branches). With (e) closed, INV-001 is again fully ✅ ENFORCED. See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-001 (e).

## [2.11.28]

### Fixed
- **`SHOP-PET-002` — buying a pet cloned the kennel template instead of re-creating it from the prototype, so pet stats were never re-rolled and the spawn RNG stream desynced from ROM.** ROM `do_buy` (`src/act_obj.c:2613`) does `pet = create_mobile(pet->pIndexData)` — a **fresh** mobile re-rolled from the index, not a copy of the kennel template's already-rolled runtime fields. `create_mobile` (`src/db.c:2047-2113`) draws the spawn RNG stream in a fixed order (gold → hp → mana → damtype-when-unset → sex-when-random) and re-rolls each value. Python's `_clone_pet_character` instead copied the template `MobInstance`'s HP/mana/gold/dam_type, so a bought pet (a) inherited the template's *cloned* random-default dam_type rather than re-rolling `number_range(1,3)`; (b) advanced the spawn RNG stream by **zero** draws, desyncing any RNG consumer ordered after the purchase versus ROM; (c) inherited HP/mana/gold from the template instead of freshly rolling them. `_handle_pet_shop_purchase` (`mud/commands/shop.py`) now creates the pet via `spawn_mob(proto.vnum)` — the `create_mobile` equivalent (single source of truth for the ROM draw order) — which also unifies the bought-pet type (`MobInstance`) with the already-`MobInstance` reload path (`_deserialize_pet`). The ROM `do_buy` overrides are reapplied to the fresh mob: `name` ← `player_name` and `short_descr` from the index (`src/db.c:2038-2039`, compensating for `from_prototype` setting `name` ← `short_descr`), `ACT_PET`, `AFF_CHARM`, and `comm` assigned outright (`src/act_obj.c:2614-2616`). The now-dead `_clone_pet_character` was removed. Regression: `tests/integration/test_shop_pet_002_create_mobile_reroll.py` — asserts the bought pet's random fields match a fresh `create_mobile` from the same seed AND that the purchase advances the RNG stream identically (a clone draws nothing — the deterministic discriminator). Surfaced 2026-05-29 while verifying SHOP-PET-001. See `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md:SHOP-PET-002`.

## [2.11.27]

### Fixed
- **`INV-001 (d)` — the `"You are still recovering."` wait-state guard double-delivered to a connected PC across 7 combat commands (SINGLE-DELIVERY family).** `do_kick`, `do_rescue`, `do_backstab`, `do_bash`, `do_berserk`, `do_flee`, and `do_cast` (`mud/commands/combat.py`) each did `char.messages.append("You are still recovering.")` **and** `return "You are still recovering."` when the actor was still recovering. The connection read loop (`mud/net/connection.py:1980-2000`) sends a command's return value AND drains `char.messages`, so a connected PC saw the line **twice** — the same INV-001 shape fixed for `do_kill` (FIGHT-020), `do_surrender`, and `do_rescue` (FIGHT-029). The message itself is not a ROM line (ROM gates wait at the interpreter level, silent), so INV-001 (d) is delivery-channel only: the fix drops the mailbox append at all 7 sites and keeps the return (the single canonical delivery). `mud/skills/registry.py:163` was deliberately excluded — it `raise`s `ValueError("still recovering")` rather than returning the line, has no production callers (only tests call `SkillRegistry.use`), and the loop sends a generic error string on exceptions (never the exception text), so its append is a single mailbox delivery in a test-only path, not a double. Regression: `tests/integration/test_still_recovering_single_delivery.py` — a grep-guard locking all 7 combat.py sites against any future re-addition (the `test_rng_determinism.py`/`test_equipment_key_convention.py` idiom) plus a behavioral connected-PC single-delivery test through `do_kick`. See `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` INV-001 (d) — now fully ✅ ENFORCED.

## [2.11.26]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-030` — `do_rescue` skipped the rescuer's PK (KILLER) flagging, so a clan PC rescuing an ally from another PC escaped the killer flag ROM imposes.** ROM `do_rescue` (`src/fight.c:3097`) calls `check_killer(ch, fch)` between the two `stop_fighting` and the two `set_fighting` calls (`:3094-3099`) — when the rescued ally is fighting **another PC** (`fch` is not an NPC), the rescuer joins that PvP fight and ROM flags it `PLR_KILLER` (+ killer timer + wiznet) exactly as `do_kill`/`do_murder` would. `do_rescue`'s only kill-stealing guard (`src/fight.c:3075`) is NPC-gated, so a PC-vs-PC rescue proceeds — precisely the case `check_killer` exists to flag. The Python `rescue()` handler (`mud/skills/handlers.py`) performed the `stop_fighting`/`set_fighting` swap but skipped `check_killer`, so the rescuer escaped the PK consequences. Now `rescue()` calls `check_killer(caster, foe)` in the ROM-faithful position. The placement is load-bearing: `check_killer` early-returns once `attacker.fighting is foe` (`mud/combat/engine.py:1291`), so it must run **before** `set_fighting(caster, foe)` or the flag would silently never fire. The common ally-vs-mob rescue is unaffected — `check_killer` early-returns when the foe is an NPC. Regression: `tests/integration/test_rescue_killer_flag.py` (PC foe → clan rescuer flagged `PlayerFlag.KILLER`, anchored on the state bit and asserting the tank swap actually ran so a missing flag can't masquerade as a bailed rescue; NPC foe → rescuer NOT flagged). Surfaced 2026-05-29 by the advisor during the FIGHT-029 close (full `do_rescue` read). See `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md:FIGHT-030`.

## [2.11.25]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-029` — `do_rescue` violated SINGLE-DELIVERY (INV-001): the rescuer's success line double-delivered to a connected PC, and the victim/room lines went out on the wrong channel.** ROM `do_rescue` (`src/fight.c:3089-3091`) is **void** and writes all three success lines straight to the descriptor via `act()` (TO_CHAR "You rescue $N!" / TO_VICT "$n rescues you!" / TO_NOTVICT "$n rescues $N!"); there is no return-value channel. The Python port had two distinct bugs. (1) `rescue()` (`mud/skills/handlers.py`) did `caster.messages.append(char_msg)` **and** `do_rescue` returned that same line; the connection loop (`mud/net/connection.py`) sends a command's return value AND drains `char.messages`, so a connected PC rescuer received "You rescue X!" **twice** — the `do_kill` (FIGHT-020) / `do_surrender` shape. (2) The TO_VICT and TO_NOTVICT legs were appended to `target.messages` / `occupant.messages` only, so a connected victim/bystander saw them late on their next command drain instead of immediately via the async push (the MAGIC-003 wrong-channel shape). Now `rescue()` delivers all three legs via `_send_to_char` (the canonical single-delivery channel, mailbox fallback preserved for disconnected chars/tests) and `do_rescue` returns `""`; the fail-path `"You fail the rescue."` `char.messages.append` was likewise dropped (return-channel only). Regression: `tests/integration/test_rescue_single_delivery.py` splits the shape — rescuer line **count-once** plus victim/bystander **push-present & mailbox-empty** (a pure double-delivery count test false-greens on the vict/room legs, which are wrong-channel rather than duplicated). Existing rescue tests realigned to the void contract (`tests/test_skills.py`, `tests/test_skill_combat_rom_parity.py`, `tests/integration/test_skills_integration.py`). Out-of-scope sibling filed: the `"You are still recovering."` wait-state guard double-delivers the same way across 7 `combat.py` commands + `skills/registry.py` (not a ROM line) — tracked as INV-001 (d) OPEN. See `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md:FIGHT-029` and `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md:INV-001`.

## [2.11.24]

### Fixed
- **`MAGIC-003` — `shield`/`sanctuary`/`blindness`/`weaken` delivered their success and room-broadcast lines via the divergent `char.messages.append` mailbox instead of the canonical single-delivery channel (INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY family).** ROM `spell_shield` (`src/magic.c:4326-4327`), `spell_sanctuary` (`:4296-4297`), `spell_blindness` (`:888-889`), and `spell_weaken` (`:4580-4581`) each send a victim line (`send_to_char` TO_VICT) and a room broadcast (`act` TO_ROOM). The Python handlers (`mud/skills/handlers.py`) applied the affect correctly but appended these lines straight to `target.messages` / `occupant.messages`. Per `mud/utils/messaging.py` (DUPL-002) and AGENTS.md "Message Delivery", `char.messages` is a fallback for disconnected characters and tests only — a connected PC must receive via the async `send_to_char` task fired by `push_message`, so the line reaches the live prompt immediately (mirroring ROM `write_to_buffer`). A raw `.append` stranded the line in the mailbox until the next command drained it, so a connected bystander saw a room broadcast (e.g. "X is surrounded by a force shield.") late. Each leg now routes through `_send_to_char` (self/victim + the already-affected branch + the per-occupant room loop), mirroring the existing `fly`/`giant_strength` handlers; the mailbox fallback for disconnected/test chars is preserved, so the existing mailbox-reading affect tests stay green. Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic_003_affect_message_channel.py` (connected-PC async-channel delivery + disconnected mailbox fallback). See `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md`.

## [2.11.23]

### Fixed
- **`CAST-003` — offensive object/character spell (`curse`/`poison`) no-target cast used the wrong ROM error wording when not fighting.** ROM's `do_cast` gives `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF` its own no-fight message, "Cast the spell on whom or what?" (`src/magic.c:471`) — the trailing "or what?" reflects that an object is also a legal operand — distinct from `TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE`'s char-only "Cast the spell on whom?" (`src/magic.c:376`). Python's `do_cast` (`mud/commands/combat.py`) routed `offensive_character_or_object` (`TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF` — `curse`, `poison`) through the same no-fight error branch as `victim` (`TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE`), so both emitted "Cast the spell on whom?". The offensive object/char branch now returns ROM's distinct "Cast the spell on whom or what?". Surfaced while de-conflating the two `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_*` types for CAST-002 (left byte-identical there to keep that a clean single-gap commit). Regression: `tests/test_skills_spells_cast_listing.py::test_do_cast_offensive_obj_char_no_target_no_fight_still_errors` (tightened from a `whom` substring check to assert the exact wording). See `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md`.

## [2.11.22]

### Fixed
- **`CAST-002` — no-arg `cast bless` / `cast invis` / `cast 'remove curse'` errored "Cast the spell on whom?" instead of self-casting.** ROM splits the two object/character target types by their no-argument default: `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF` defaults to self (`src/magic.c:514-519`) while `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF` defaults to the fighting victim and errors when not fighting (`src/magic.c:466-473`). The Python skill-conversion (`mud/scripts/convert_skills_to_json.py`) collapsed **both** ROM `TAR_*` types into a single `"character_or_object"` string, and `do_cast` (`mud/commands/combat.py`) routed that one string through the *offensive* default — so the three **defensive** object/char spells (`bless`, `invisibility`, `remove curse` — all `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF` in `src/const.c`) wrongly demanded a target on a no-arg self-cast. Fix restores ROM's 1:1 `TAR_*` mapping: the converter now emits `defensive_character_or_object` (`TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF`) and `offensive_character_or_object` (`TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF`); `data/skills.json` updated for the 5 affected spells; `do_cast` routes the defensive string with `friendly` (self default) and the offensive string with `victim` (fighting default, byte-identical to prior behavior — `curse`/`poison` unchanged). `mob_cmds.py` `_TARGET_STRINGS` maps both new strings (ROM `do_mpcast` collapses DEF/OFF identically, `src/mob_cmds.c:1060-1065`). Surfaced while writing the MAGIC-002 bless self-cast tests, which had to bypass `do_cast` because of this bug. Regression: `tests/test_skills_spells_cast_listing.py::test_do_cast_defensive_obj_char_no_target_defaults_to_self` (+ offensive-unchanged guard). The `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_*` object-target legs remain deferred; the distinct `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF` no-fight wording ("Cast the spell on whom or what?", `src/magic.c:471`) is filed separately as **CAST-003**. See `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md`.

## [2.11.21]

### Fixed
- **`MAGIC-002` — `bless` was silent on a successful cast (the genuinely-silent instance of the affect-spell sweep).** ROM `spell_bless` (`src/magic.c:836-865`, character branch) sends "You feel righteous." to the victim on success and `act("You grant $N the favor of your god.")` to the caster for a cross-target cast; the already-affected branch — which ROM also takes when `victim->position == POS_FIGHTING` (`src/magic.c:840`, a deliberate quirk: a fighting target is treated as already-blessed even with no bless affect) — sends "You are already blessed." (self) / `act("$N already has divine favor.")` (cross-target). The Python `bless` handler (`mud/skills/handlers.py`) applied the +hitroll / −saving-throw affect but was **silent** on success, and the already-affected branch returned `False` with no message at all (since `do_cast` is silent on a successful cast — FINDING-013 — the line was dropped entirely). `bless` now mirrors ROM's messaging faithfully. The `spell_bless` object-target branch (`TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF` obj case, `src/magic.c:788-834`) remains deferred — unreachable until `do_cast` routes object targets. This also makes `spell_holy_word`'s `bless` sub-cast (`src/magic.c:3304`) faithfully emit the bless line to affected targets. Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic_002_bless_message.py` (5 tests). Sibling residuals filed: **MAGIC-003** (`shield`/`sanctuary`/`weaken`/`blindness` deliver via the divergent `char.messages.append` channel — wrong-channel, not silent), **CAST-002** (`do_cast` maps `character_or_object` to the offensive default, so the defensive `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF` spells `bless`/`invisibility`/`remove curse` wrongly error "Cast the spell on whom?" on a no-arg self-cast instead of defaulting to self). See `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md`.

## [2.11.20]

### Fixed
- **`MAGIC-002` / `FINDING-015` — affect spells emitted no ROM success message when cast through `do_cast` (armor instance).** ROM `spell_armor` (`src/magic.c:753-777`) sends "You feel someone protecting you." to the victim on a successful cast (and `act("$N is protected by your magic.")` to the caster for a cross-target cast); the already-affected branch is "You are already armored." (self) / `act("$N is already armored.")`. The Python `armor` handler (`mud/skills/handlers.py`) applied the −20 AC affect but was *silent* on success, and since `do_cast` is silent on a successful cast (FINDING-013 — all output comes from the spell function), the line was dropped entirely. The Python already-affected branch also sent the non-ROM "They are already protected." `armor` now mirrors ROM's messaging faithfully. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness` `affect_armor` scenario, step 3: C `['You feel someone protecting you.']` vs py `[]`; affects/eff_ac/mana all converged — only `output` diverged). Regression: `tests/integration/test_magic_002_armor_message.py`. **Class, not one-off:** `bless` (`handlers.py:1465`) and `shield` (`handlers.py:7094`) are likewise silent on success — every affect-only spell cast via `do_cast` is missing its ROM success line; the broader sweep is filed under `MAGIC-002` in `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md` as follow-up (this fixes the `armor` instance the `affect_armor` scenario exercises).

## [2.11.19]

### Fixed
- **`FINDING-013` — `do_cast` emitted a spurious "You cast <spell>." line ROM never sends.** ROM `do_cast` (`src/magic.c:553-563`) is silent on a *successful* cast — it deducts mana, calls the spell function, and `check_improve`, sending nothing itself; all player-facing output comes from the spell function (e.g. `damage()` → "Your magic missile maims the drunk."). Python's `do_cast` returned `f"You cast {skill.name}."`, which the command dispatcher sends to the player (`mud/net/connection.py`), so the player saw an extra confirmation line above the spell's own message. `do_cast` now returns `""` on success; the spell handler already delivers its messages via `char.messages`. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness` `spell_combat` scenario, step 5: C `['Your magic missile maims the drunk.']` vs py `['You cast magic missile.', 'Your magic missile maims the drunk.']`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_finding_013_cast_silent_on_success.py`. (`skill_registry.cast`'s separate `_default_success_message` "You cast X." fallback — used by mob/item casting and returning a result object — is a distinct path the differential did not exercise; left unchanged.)

### Changed
- Re-baselined `tests/test_skills_spells_cast_listing.py::test_do_cast_offensive_no_target_defaults_to_fighting_victim`: it asserted `do_cast` returns `"You cast magic missile."`; ROM is silent on success (FINDING-013), so the return is now `""`. The test's meaningful assertions (the fighting victim takes damage, the caster is unharmed) are unchanged. Per AGENTS.md, a test asserting non-ROM behavior is the test's bug.

## [2.11.18]

### Fixed
- **`FINDING-012` — casting a `saves_spell` offensive spell at an NPC crashed (`MobInstance` lacked `saving_throw`).** ROM `CHAR_DATA.saving_throw` is a field shared by PCs and NPCs; `saves_spell` (`src/magic.c:170`) reads `victim->saving_throw` for every target. The Python `MobInstance` dataclass mirrors many `CHAR_DATA` fields but omitted `saving_throw`, so any offensive spell routing through `saves_spell` (magic missile, fireball, etc.) raised `AttributeError: 'MobInstance' object has no attribute 'saving_throw'` when cast at a real NPC — surfacing as a "Spell cast failed: …" line (`do_cast` wraps the spell function in try/except). No prior test caught it: existing spell tests use a `Character` victim or monkeypatch `saves_spell` away. Added `saving_throw: int = 0` to `MobInstance` (mirrors ROM `create_mobile`, which leaves a mob's `saving_throw` at 0). **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (new `tools/diff_harness` `spell_combat` scenario, step 5). Regression: `tests/integration/test_finding_012_npc_spell_save.py`.

## [2.11.17]

### Changed
- **`SHOP-PET-001` reclassified N/A (premise-incorrect).** The filed gap claimed a bought pet's `dam_type` ends up `0` → attack-table index 0 → noun "hit", because `mud/commands/shop.py::_clone_pet_character` was believed to read `proto.dam_type` (which the loader leaves at 0; the `.are` word lands on `proto.damage_type`). Verified the premise is factually wrong: the clone reads the kennel `MobInstance`'s `dam_type`, not the proto's — and that instance is created by `apply_resets` → `spawn_mob` → `MobInstance.from_prototype`, which already resolves the damtype word to a non-zero attack-table index (FIGHT-023; ROM resolves it on the proto at load, `src/db2.c:270`). End-to-end, a bought pet of a "beating" proto gets `dam_type == 13` and renders noun "beating", never 0/"hit". No code change. Added a regression guard, `tests/integration/test_shop_pet_001_dam_type_resolution.py`, so a future "fix" that switches the clone to `proto.dam_type` (which would reintroduce the "hit" symptom) is caught.
- **Filed `SHOP-PET-002` (open).** The genuine residual divergence surfaced while verifying SHOP-PET-001: ROM `do_buy` does `pet = create_mobile(pet->pIndexData)` (`src/act_obj.c:2613`) — a *fresh* re-roll from the index — where `_clone_pet_character` copies the kennel template's runtime fields. So a no-word proto's random-default dam_type is cloned (ROM re-rolls per `create_mobile`), the pet purchase does not advance the spawn RNG stream the way `create_mobile` does (`src/db.c:2047-2113`), and HP/mana/gold are inherited rather than freshly rolled. Tracked in `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md`; not fixed here (it changes RNG-stream ordering and breaks the existing pet-shop gold/stat assertions — out of scope for the SHOP-PET-001 verification).

## [2.11.16]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-028` / FINDING-011 — combat miss line dropped the attack noun (IMPORTANT).** ROM `dam_message` (`src/fight.c:2157`) chooses its message template purely on `dt == TYPE_HIT` vs not — a miss (`dam == 0`) only swaps the verb to "misses"; it never changes which template branch renders. So an NPC with a resolved attack type (e.g. the drunk #3064, `dt = TYPE_HIT + 13` "beating") that *misses* renders `"The drunk's beating misses you."` (noun + "misses"), exactly like its own *hit* path. Python's `mud/combat/messages.py::dam_message` had a `percent <= 0` early-return that forced the **no-noun** `TYPE_HIT` template for *any* miss — and for any low-damage hit that rounded to percent 0 — regardless of `dt`, so it rendered `"The drunk misses you."`. Deleted the block so the no-noun output is keyed solely on `attack is None` (i.e. `dt == TYPE_HIT`); `_severity_terms` already returns the "miss"/"misses" verbs for `damage <= 0`, and the existing noun branch handles the resolved-`dt` case. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-011 `combat_melee_rounds` step 7, once FIGHT-027 advanced convergence past the round-2 damage divergence). Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_028_miss_attack_noun.py`. Closes FINDING-011.

### Changed
- Re-baselined 5 stale combat-message unit assertions that asserted the noun-less miss form ROM never produces for `dt != TYPE_HIT`: `tests/test_combat.py::test_kick_command_failure` & `::test_ac_influences_hit_chance`, `tests/test_combat_thac0_engine.py::test_thac0_path_hit_and_miss` & `::test_weapon_skill_influences_thac0`, and `tests/test_skills.py::test_kick_failure`. Each uses an attacker with a resolved `dt` (a `kick` skill noun, or a `dam_type=BASH` → attack-table noun), so ROM renders `"Your kick/slice misses ..."` — the previous `"You miss ..."` expectation was the bug, not the code (per AGENTS.md, a test contradicting ROM is the test's bug). No production behavior change beyond FIGHT-028 itself.

## [2.11.15]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-027` / FINDING-010 — unarmed-NPC damage used the PC unarmed formula instead of the mob damage dice (CRITICAL).** ROM `one_hit` (`src/fight.c:522-560`) routes an NPC attacker with no wielded weapon through a dedicated branch that rolls the mob's own damage dice: `dam = dice(ch->damage[DICE_NUMBER], ch->damage[DICE_TYPE])` (ROM `convert_mobile` upgrades *every* mob to `new_format` at load, so the dice path is universal at runtime — the `!new_format` `number_range(ch->level/2, ch->level*3/2)` sub-branch is dead code). `mud/combat/engine.py::calculate_weapon_damage` had **no NPC branch**, so an unarmed mob fell through to the PC-unarmed `else` clause `number_range(1 + 4*skill/100, 2*ch->level/3*skill/100)`. For the drunk #3064 (level 2, damage dice 1d6, skill_total ≈ 50) that collapsed to a **degenerate `number_range(3, 0)`** (`from > to` → ROM returns `from` = constant 3, consuming **zero** `number_mm` draws), so the Python drunk dealt a constant 3 every hit where ROM rolls `dice(1, 6)` (range 1–6, one `number_mm` draw) — *and* the missing draw desynced the shared combat RNG stream from round 2 onward. `calculate_weapon_damage` now resolves an unarmed NPC (`is_npc and wield is None`) via `rng_mm.dice(damage[DICE_NUMBER], damage[DICE_TYPE])`, using the `MobInstance.damage` tuple (the `[2]` bonus is applied later via damroll). **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-010 `combat_melee_rounds` step 6: C `"beating scratches you"` (1 dmg, ≤5% tier) vs py `"beating hits you"` (3 dmg, ≤15% tier); the C drunk's round-4 hit of 5 is unreachable by `number_range(level/2, level*3/2)`=1–3, proving the dice path). The harness now converges on all 8 steps (hp + severity verbs match end-to-end); the first divergence advanced to a *new* miss-line rendering gap (filed as FINDING-011 / `FIGHT-028`: ROM `"$n's beating misses you"` vs py `"$n misses you"`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_027_npc_unarmed_damage_dice.py`. Closes FINDING-010.

## [2.11.14]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-025` / FINDING-009 (facet 4) — combat act() output did not capitalize its first character (CRITICAL).** ROM `act_new` (`src/comm.c:2373-2379`) upper-cases the first character of every rendered act() line, accounting for a leading `{X` colour code (`if (buf[0] == '{') buf[2] = UPPER(buf[2]); else buf[0] = UPPER(buf[0])`), so `{4the drunk's beating hits you.{x` is sent as `{4The drunk's beating hits you.{x`. Python's combat render chokepoint `mud/combat/messages.py::render_for` (which mirrors ROM's `act()` macro) substituted the PERS placeholders but never capitalized, so every NPC-initiated swing/spell line rendered lowercase ("the drunk's ..."). `render_for` now applies the ROM `act_new` capitalization (`_capitalize_act`). **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-009 `combat_melee_rounds` step-5 line 1: `the drunk's beating` vs ROM `The drunk's beating`). With FIGHT-021/022/023/024 this closes FINDING-009. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_025_act_capitalization.py`. (Scoped to the combat act chokepoint; `broadcast_room`/`act_format` capitalization is filed as a separate follow-up `ACT-CAP-001` — ROM capitalizes all act() output but that is a much wider surface.)

### Changed
- Hardened `tests/test_combat_skills.py::test_enhanced_damage_checks_improve`: pinned the ROM THAC0 / `number_bits(5)` attack roll to nat-19 (always hits). The test faked `number_percent`/`number_range` but left `number_bits` live, so `attack_round`'s hit roll depended on the unseeded combat-stream position — under parallel execution a sibling-shifted stream could roll a miss and leave the skill un-improved. Pre-existing brittleness (not caused by FIGHT-025; it touches no RNG), surfaced by FIGHT-025's parallel suite run. Same RNG-stream brittleness class as the 2.11.8 / FIGHT-021 / FIGHT-024 re-baselines.

## [2.11.13]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-023` / FINDING-009 (facet 2) — mob `dam_type` was a DamageType class, not the ROM attack_table index, so NPCs rendered the wrong attack noun (CRITICAL).** ROM stores `ch->dam_type = attack_lookup(word)` — an **attack_table index** (`src/db2.c:270`, `src/handler.c:165`); `one_hit`/`dam_message` render the noun as `attack_table[ch->dam_type].noun` (`src/fight.c:2176`) and derive the damage *class* separately via `attack_table[ch->dam_type].damage` (`src/fight.c:431`). `mud/spawning/templates.py::_resolve_damage_type` collapsed the index into a DamageType class (`int(DamageType.BASH) == 1`), but `mud/combat/engine.py` reads `attacker.dam_type` as an attack-table index — so the drunk #3064 (damtype "beating" → index 13) rendered `attack_table[1].noun == "slice"` instead of "beating". The random-default block also assigned DamageType values (`3/1/2`) where ROM `create_mobile` (`src/db.c:2086-2099`) assigns attack-table indices `3/7/11` (slash/pound/pierce). `_resolve_damage_type` now returns the attack-table index throughout (dropping the DamageType-enum-name fallback, which could resolve a damtype word like "fire" to a nonzero class and silently suppress ROM's `number_range(1,3)` default roll — a combat-stream desync); the random default assigns ROM's literal `3/7/11`. The damage class is still derived at hit time via `attack_damage_type(index)` in `one_hit` (unchanged), so the drunk now correctly resolves class DAM_BASH (was DAM_SLASH) — fixing its AC-index/THAC0/RIV as well as the noun. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-009 `combat_melee_rounds` step 5: `the drunk's slice` vs ROM `The drunk's beating`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_023_mob_dam_type_attack_index.py`.

### Changed
- Re-baselined `tests/test_spawning.py::test_spawned_mob_without_damage_type_rolls_rom_defaults` and `::test_spawned_mob_translates_attack_index_damage_type`: both asserted the old conflated `dam_type == int(DamageType.BASH) == 1`; the ROM-faithful value is the attack-table index `7` ("pound") — the random-default roll 2 maps to index 7 (`src/db.c:2086-2099`), and a proto damtype of `7` is preserved as index 7 (ROM does not translate it to a class). The damage class is derived at hit time. No production behavior change beyond FIGHT-023 itself.

## [2.11.12]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-024` / FINDING-009 (facet 3) — combat ticks resolved swings in the reverse of ROM's order, desyncing the shared combat RNG stream (CRITICAL).** ROM `src/fight.c:76` `violence_update` walks `char_list` from the head, and every newly created actor is **prepended** to `char_list` (`src/db.c:2256-2257` `create_mobile`, `src/nanny.c:757-758` PC login), so `char_list` is in reverse-creation order — the most-recently-loaded actor swings first. Python's `character_registry` is append-order (creation order), and `mud/game_loop.py::violence_tick` walked it forward, the exact reverse of ROM. Because the combat RNG stream is shared across every swing in a tick, *who swings first* determines who consumes the stream first, so the forward walk shifted every downstream swing's hit/miss vs ROM. `violence_tick` now iterates `list(reversed(character_registry))` (snapshot mirrors ROM's `ch_next = ch->next` guard against mid-tick deaths). **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-009 `combat_melee_rounds`): the drunk #3064 (loaded after the player) must swing first as in ROM, but Python swung the player first. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_024_violence_tick_order.py`. With FIGHT-021+022 this completes the combat-tick RNG **draw-order** side of FINDING-009; the remaining step-5 diffs are render-only (facet 2 dam_type noun, facet 4 act capitalization). (Exposed a latent FIGHT-022 crash in the NPC `do_X` dispatch — fixed first as FIGHT-026.)

## [2.11.11]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-026` — NPC offensive-skill commands (`do_dirt`/`do_trip`/`do_disarm`) crashed when invoked by `mob_hit` (CRITICAL; latent FIGHT-022 fallout).** FIGHT-022's `_mob_offensive_skill` dispatches the real command handlers on the NPC attacker, as ROM `mob_hit` does. `do_bash`/`do_kick`/`do_berserk` already gate NPCs on their `OFF_` flag, but `do_dirt`/`do_trip`/`do_disarm` read `char.skills.get(...)` directly — `MobInstance` has no `skills` dict, so any flagged mob that rolled those branches crashed with `AttributeError`. `do_trip` had a second crash: its DEX modifier indexed `getattr(victim, "perm_stat", [13]*5)[1]`, which `IndexError`s on the empty-list `perm_stat` default (the `[13]*5` fallback only fires when the attribute is *missing*, not empty). The crash was latent at FIGHT-022 commit time (no test rolled a flagged mob into those branches) and was surfaced by FIGHT-024's combat-tick reorder: the mayor #3143 (OFF_TRIP) then rolled into `do_trip` during `test_kill_mob_grants_xp_integration`. `do_dirt`/`do_trip` now mirror the `do_kick` NPC pattern (gate on the `OFF_` flag, treat the skill as learned for NPCs); `do_disarm` skips the PC percent gate for NPCs and reads hand-to-hand via the NPC-safe helper; `do_trip`'s DEX read now uses the canonical bounds-safe `get_curr_stat(Stat.DEX)` (also more ROM-faithful — current vs permanent stat). Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_026_npc_offensive_skill_no_crash.py`. **Closes only the crash** — per-command RNG-draw fidelity for flagged-mob `do_X` remains unverified (tracked as a FIGHT_C_AUDIT follow-up; the differential can't exercise it because the drunk #3064 has no `OFF_` flags).

### Changed
- Re-baselined `tests/integration/test_group_combat.py::TestGroupExperienceSharing::test_group_xp_split_between_members`: pinned the ROM THAC0 / `number_bits(5)` attack roll to nat-19 (always hits) so the 3-member group deterministically fells the 50-hp mob within the 60-tick budget. The test verifies XP *split*, not hit chance; a high hitroll alone leaves nat-0 misses, so under parallel execution the unseeded combat-stream position (resequenced by the FIGHT-022 `mob_hit` draws and the FIGHT-024 tick reorder) could leave the mob alive at the budget and grant no XP. Same RNG-stream brittleness class as the 2.11.8 pass and the FIGHT-021 XP-test re-baseline. No production behavior change.

## [2.11.10]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-022` / FINDING-009 (facet 1) — NPC combat rounds skipped ROM's mob spell/skill RNG rolls, desyncing the combat-tick stream (CRITICAL).** ROM `src/fight.c` routes NPC attackers through a separate `mob_hit()` (`if (IS_NPC(ch)) { mob_hit(ch,victim,dt); return; }`), which after the (unconditional, FIGHT-021) 2nd/3rd-attack `number_percent()` checks rolls two more values **when the mob is not waiting**: `number_range(0,2)` (mob spell-cast check — `mob_cast_mage`/`mob_cast_cleric` are stubbed in ROM) and `number_range(0,8)` (off-skill dispatch by OFF_ flag). The Python port had no NPC `mob_hit` branch — `mud/combat/engine.py::multi_hit` handled PC and NPC identically — so every NPC combat round drew **two fewer** `number_range` values than ROM, shifting the shared combat RNG stream for every later swing in the tick. Added a faithful `mob_hit` (one_hit → OFF_AREA_ATTACK sweep → haste/OFF_FAST extra swing → unconditional 2nd/3rd draws → `wait>0` gate → the two `number_range` draws → `_mob_offensive_skill` switch: bash/berserk/disarm/kick/kick-dirt/trip/backstab by OFF_ flag, tail+crush no-op as in ROM); `multi_hit` dispatches to it for NPC attackers. The two `number_range` draws fire even for a flag-less mob (the drunk #3064) — they are part of the shared RNG stream. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-009): the drunk's round consumed fewer draws than ROM `mob_hit`, so the player's follow-up swing read a shifted stream. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_022_mob_hit_skill_rolls.py`. **Closes FINDING-009 facet 1 with FIGHT-021.** The `do_X`-on-mob dispatch is faithful to ROM's structure; its per-command draw fidelity for flagged mobs is unverified (no flagged mob exercises it in the suite — file a follow-up if a `do_X` is later found to diverge). Full combat + integration suite green (2594 passed).

## [2.11.9]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-021` / FINDING-009 (facet 1) — `multi_hit` skipped the second/third-attack RNG draws for skill-less attackers, desyncing the combat-tick stream (CRITICAL).** ROM `src/fight.c` `multi_hit` (PC) and `mob_hit` (NPC) resolve the 2nd/3rd extra attacks with `if (number_percent() < chance)`. `number_percent()` is the LEFT operand, so the RNG draw fires **unconditionally** — even when `chance == 0` for an attacker with no second/third-attack skill (every mob without those skills, every low-level mage). `mud/combat/engine.py::multi_hit` guarded the draw behind `if second_attack_skill > 0:` / `if third_attack_skill > 0:`, so a 0-skill attacker drew **two fewer** `number_percent()` values than ROM, shifting the shared combat RNG stream for every later swing in the tick. Both checks now compute `chance` and draw `number_percent()` unconditionally (guards removed); `chance` stays 0 for a skill-less attacker so no extra swing lands, but the draw now matches ROM. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-009): in `combat_melee_rounds` the drunk #3064's `mob_hit` consumed fewer draws than ROM, so the player's follow-up swing read a shifted stream and resolved to a hit (`You scratch`) where ROM produced a miss (`You miss`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_021_multi_hit_unconditional_draw.py`. **Partial close of FINDING-009 facet 1** — the NPC `mob_hit` path still omits ROM's `number_range(0,2)` mob-cast + `number_range(0,8)` mob-skill draws (tracked as FIGHT-022).

### Changed
- Re-baselined `tests/integration/test_character_advancement.py::test_kill_mob_grants_xp_integration`: pinned the ROM THAC0 / `number_bits(5)` attack roll to nat-19 (always hits) so the kill→XP flow does not depend on the combat RNG stream position. FIGHT-021's two extra (ROM-faithful) draws resequenced the stream, which let the test's fixed 60-tick budget lapse while room 3001's aggressive Hassan joined and removed the player — the same RNG-stream brittleness class the 2.11.8 pass addressed. The test exercises XP-on-kill, not hit probability. Full combat + integration suite green (2541 passed).

## [2.11.8]

### Changed
- **Combat-test determinism: pinned the ROM `number_bits(5)` attack roll in the unseeded outcome-asserting tests in `tests/test_combat.py`.** After FIGHT-019 made THAC0 the only hit model, these tests resolved hits via the unseeded `number_bits` stream and passed only by RNG-stream position — they could flake on the nat-0/nat-19 edge depending on xdist worker grouping (a clean parallel run flaked `test_one_hit_uses_equipped_weapon`). Each outcome-brittle test now pins `number_bits` to nat-19 (always hits) or nat-0 (`test_attack_misses_target`, always misses), making them deterministic under the ROM model. Tests whose only assertion is `assert_attack_message` (true for both hit and miss) or that count attacks rather than hits were left unchanged (not outcome-brittle). No production behavior change. Verified: `test_combat.py` 32/32 across 3 serial runs + clean full parallel suite (4934 passed).

## [2.11.7]

### Fixed
- **INV-001 — `do_surrender` leaked the NPC counterattack to the surrendering player (SINGLE-DELIVERY + wrong perspective).** When a PC surrenders to an NPC that ignores it (no `TRIG_SURR`), `mud/commands/combat.py::do_surrender` ran `attack_messages = multi_hit(opponent, char)` and folded the result into its own return value — which the connection loop sends to the surrendering PC. So the PC received the NPC's counterattack **twice**: once correctly via the TO_VICT `_push_message` ("the brute hits you", `{4…{x`), and once as the returned **attacker-perspective** line ("You hit …", `{2…{x`) — a return-value double-send plus a wrong-perspective leak. ROM `do_surrender` (`src/fight.c:3239-3240`) calls `multi_hit(mob, ch, TYPE_UNDEFINED)` as a void statement (output flows through `act()`/`send_to_char`), so the return is now discarded like `do_kill` (FIGHT-020). This closes the last open INV-001 follow-up (b). Regression: `tests/integration/test_surrender_single_delivery.py`.

## [2.11.6]

### Fixed
- **INV-001 — `broadcast_room` / `broadcast_global` double-delivered every room/global broadcast to connected players (SINGLE-DELIVERY).** `mud/net/protocol.py`'s `broadcast_room` and `broadcast_global` appended each message to BOTH the fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))` send AND `char.messages`. For a connected PC the async send delivers immediately and the connection read loop (`mud/net/connection.py`) then drains `char.messages` after the next command — so every death/position-change/arrival/channel line routed through these helpers replayed once more on the next prompt. Both functions now deliver connection-XOR-mailbox (async send for connected PCs, `char.messages` fallback for disconnected characters and tests), mirroring `mud/utils/messaging.py:push_message`. This was the open follow-up (a) filed under INV-001 alongside FIGHT-020; surfaced by the FIGHT-020 death-path delivery test (`{RVictim is DEAD!!{x` and `... hits the ground ... DEAD.` each delivered twice to the connected killer). Regression: `tests/integration/test_broadcast_room_single_delivery.py`. The ~195 broadcast call sites are unchanged; connection-less recipients still queue to the mailbox exactly as before (full suite green, 4933 passed).
- **Still open (INV-001 follow-up b): `do_surrender`** (`mud/commands/combat.py`, NPC-ignores-surrender branch) returns `multi_hit(...)` output — the surrendering PC gets the TO_VICT push AND a returned attacker-perspective line (return-value double-send + wrong-perspective leak). Tracked under INV-001; needs its own fix.

## [2.11.5]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-020` / FINDING-008 (sub-issue 3) — `kill` double-delivered every combat line to connected players (CRITICAL, SINGLE-DELIVERY/INV-001).** `mud/commands/combat.py::do_kill` returned `multi_hit(...)[0]` — the attacker's combat line that `apply_damage` had **already** delivered via `_push_message`. The connection read loop (`mud/net/connection.py`) sends a command's return value AND drains the push, so a connected PC received every `kill`-initiated combat line **twice** (async push send + `send_to_char(char, response)`) — the same class as the previously-fixed WS death-path double-message bug. ROM's `do_kill` (`src/fight.c:2771-2817`) is void; nearly every other `multi_hit` caller (`do_murder`, `violence_tick`, `assist`, aggressive AI, `spec_funs`) already discards the return and relies on the push (the exception, `do_surrender`'s NPC-ignores branch, is a second instance — see follow-up below). `do_kill` now runs `multi_hit(char, victim)` and returns `""`. This also stops delivering the non-ROM `"You kill X."` line (`_handle_death`'s return) that only surfaced on the `kill` first strike — ROM (`src/fight.c:859-862`) sends the killer nothing on death; the killing-blow dam_message (pushed before the death branch) is the killer's last line. Proven end-to-end with a mock-connection delivery harness: `tests/integration/test_kill_command_single_delivery.py`. Broadens INV-001 (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`). **Re-triage note:** the 2.11.4 (FIGHT-019) session had recorded this sub-issue as a "harness capture artifact, not a SINGLE-DELIVERY violation" — that was wrong; it is a real engine bug affecting live connected players, confirmed here.
- **Follow-ups filed (not yet fixed), same SINGLE-DELIVERY (INV-001) contract:** (a) `broadcast_room`/`broadcast_global` (`mud/net/protocol.py`) append to BOTH the async `send_to_char` task and `char.messages`, so a connected PC in the room receives every room broadcast (death/position-change/etc.) twice — surfaced by the FIGHT-020 death-path test. (b) `do_surrender` (`mud/commands/combat.py`, NPC-ignores-surrender branch) returns `multi_hit(...)` output, so the surrendering PC gets the TO_VICT push AND a returned attacker-perspective line — the same return-value double-send as `do_kill`, plus a wrong-perspective leak. Both tracked under INV-001; each needs its own failing-test-first fix.

### Changed
- 11 combat-content-return assertions across `tests/test_combat.py`, `tests/test_combat_thac0_engine.py`, and `tests/test_combat_defenses_prob.py` re-baselined to read the pushed combat line from `char.messages` (via a `deliver_kill` helper) instead of `do_kill`'s return value, which is now `""`. `tests/integration/test_fight_c_do_kill_parity.py` asserts `do_kill` returns `""` and pins the multi_hit attack sequence.

## [2.11.4]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-019` / FINDING-008 (sub-issue 1) — combat shipped a non-ROM hit model game-wide (CRITICAL).** ROM `one_hit` (`src/fight.c:386-516`) resolves every melee swing through a single model: the THAC0 / `number_bits(5)` attack roll (re-roll loop until `< 20`, miss on `diceroll == 0` or `diceroll != 19 && diceroll < thac0 - victim_ac`). The Python port shipped this faithful path behind a `COMBAT_USE_THAC0` feature flag **defaulted to False**, so production combat ran a non-ROM percent model instead (`50 + hitroll + AC/2`, rolled with `number_percent()`) — diverging from ROM on both the RNG draw *and* the hit/miss decision. `mud/combat/engine.py::attack_round` now uses the THAC0 model exclusively; the percent branch and the `COMBAT_USE_THAC0` flag (`mud/config.py`) are deleted. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-008): from seed 777 the drunk #3064's first incoming attack is a `miss` in ROM C but registered a `scratch` (hit) under the percent model. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_019_thac0_attack_roll.py`.
- **NPC-attacker THAC0 branch was missing (masked by the flag).** Making THAC0 the only path exposed that `attack_round`/`compute_thac0` always indexed the PC `class_table[attacker.ch_class]`, which raises `AttributeError` for NPC attackers (`MobInstance` has no `ch_class`) and ignored ROM's NPC rule. Per ROM `src/fight.c:445-457`, NPC attackers use `thac0_00 = 20` and a `thac0_32` keyed off their ACT class flag (WARRIOR -10 / THIEF -4 / CLERIC 2 / MAGE 6, default -4). `compute_thac0` gained a `thac0_pair` override and `attack_round` now selects the NPC pair from act flags. Regression: `tests/test_combat_thac0.py::test_thac0_npc_pair_overrides_class_table`, `tests/integration/test_fight_019_thac0_attack_roll.py::test_fight_019_npc_attacker_thac0_pair_from_act_flag`.
- **Test isolation:** `tests/integration/test_mob_ai.py`'s `test_room` fixture now restores room 3001's `.people` after each test. THAC0's lower kill rate (vs the retired percent model) left an aggressive mob's victim alive in the shared room across tests, causing a later level-difference test to attack the leftover. (15 percent-model-dependent combat tests were re-baselined ROM-faithfully as part of this change.)

## [2.11.3]

### Fixed
- **`SPAWN-001` / FINDING-007 — mob spawn RNG draw-order diverged from ROM game-wide (CRITICAL).** ROM `create_mobile` (`src/db.c:2047-2113`) draws the spawn RNG stream in a fixed order — **gold/wealth → HP dice → mana dice → random damtype (when `dam_type == 0`) → random sex (when `sex == EITHER`)**. `mud/spawning/templates.py::MobInstance.from_prototype` drew them in nearly the reverse order (sex first, damtype next, gold last), so every seed-dependent mob landed at a different RNG stream position than ROM. Concretely: ROM's gold draw precedes the HP roll, so the drunk #3064 rolled HP **31** in ROM C but **33** in Python from the same seed. Reordered `from_prototype`'s draws to mirror ROM exactly (using the real `rng_mm` primitives, which short-circuit `number_range`/`dice` without consuming the stream, so the draw *count* stays data-dependent and correct). The `create_mobile` row in `DB_C_AUDIT.md` had been certified on stat-copy parity; the RNG **ordering** contract was never checked — corrected. **Surfaced by the combat differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-007). Regression: `tests/integration/test_spawn_001_rng_draw_order.py`.

## [2.11.2]

### Fixed
- **`DB2-007` — mob HP/mana/damage dice were mislabeled game-wide (CRITICAL).** `mud/loaders/mob_loader.py` read a phantom scalar `ac` token at index [2] of the ROM new-format mob stat line. But ROM's stat line is `level hitroll <hp-dice> <mana-dice> <dam-dice> damtype` — the four AC values are on the *following* line (`src/db2.c:273-276`), so there is no scalar AC there. The phantom token shifted every dice field by one: `hit_dice` got the mana dice, `mana_dice` the damage dice, `damage_dice` the damtype word, and the real **HP dice was dropped**. Every JSON-loaded mob therefore spawned with the wrong HP, mana, and damage (e.g. Hassan #3001 had 100 HP instead of 1000; the drunk #3064 had 100 instead of `2d6+22`≈31). Fix reads the dice from [2]/[3]/[4]/[5]; the vestigial OLC-only `MobIndex.ac` field now defaults to `"1d1+0"`. **All 52 area JSONs regenerated** from the corrected loader (45 changed). Latent for the project's life because the test suite uses synthetic mobs with explicit HP — **surfaced by the combat differential testing harness** (`tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md` FINDING-006). Regression: `tests/test_mob_dice_parity.py`. The per-file `DB2_C_AUDIT.md` had marked this stat line ✅ in Phase 2; corrected.

## [2.11.1]

### Fixed
- **FINDING-005 — differential-harness input-source asymmetry, RESOLVED.** The C shim reads the repaired `midgaard` `.are` overlay while the Python replay reads `data/areas/*.json`. A probe proved the two sources cover an identical room/mobile/object vnum set (143/65/160 each — the JSON was generated from a correctly-parsed source, not the malformed stock `area/midgaard.are`), so the asymmetry was structurally benign. Locked with a guard: `tests/test_diff_harness_data_parity.py` reconstructs the repaired `.are` in-Python (byte-identical to the `Makefile.diffshim` overlay awk, so it needs no build artifact) and asserts its vnum sets equal the JSON the Python loader reads — any future edit that desyncs the two engines' world data now fails. This was the last harness-soundness follow-up gating a `diff-harness` → `master` merge. Details: `tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md`.

## [2.11.0]

### Added
- **Differential testing harness (ROM C ⇄ Python), v1** (`tools/diff_harness/`). A local golden-trace capture/replay tool that runs the Python port and the original ROM 2.4b6 C engine through identical scripted scenarios and diffs observable state + output, surfacing parity divergences mechanically. The usual nondeterminism blocker is already solved here: the C engine is built with `-DOLD_RAND` so its Mitchell-Moore RNG matches `mud/utils/rng_mm.py` bit-for-bit. **Capture** drives an additively-instrumented C binary (`src/diffshim`, built via `src/Makefile.diffshim` — ROM `src/*.c` unchanged, all macOS portability via compile flags + shim headers) over stdin and records committed golden traces (`tests/data/golden/diff/`). **Replay** (`tests/test_differential_smoke.py`, pure-Python, no C build needed) drives the Python engine through the same scenario, snapshots state, normalizes both sides identically, and asserts equality. v1 covers a deterministic smoke slice (look/movement/get/drop/inventory). Design + plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-differential-testing-harness-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-28-differential-testing-harness.md`. Workflow: `tools/diff_harness/README.md`.

### Fixed
- **FINDING-001 (harness's first catch) — RESOLVED via LOOK-001/LOOK-002** (2.10.1 / 2.10.2). The harness's first run surfaced a divergence: room `look` rendered an NPC by name vs ROM's `long_descr`. Root cause was a real parity bug (not the data asymmetry): `MobInstance` didn't carry `long_descr`/`description` from its prototype and `mud/world/look.py` used the PERS path instead of `show_char_to_char_0`'s long_descr branch. Fixed on master; the differential `movement_get_drop` diff is now clean and the `KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` xfail removed. (The separate harness input-source asymmetry — C reads `.are`, Python reads JSON — was investigated and resolved in 2.11.1, FINDING-005.)
## [2.10.5]

### Fixed
- **`LOOK-004` — room object listing now shows the ROM ground `description`, not `short_descr`** (ROM `src/act_info.c` `format_obj_to_char`). `do_look` rendered each room object as `obj.short_descr` (e.g. "the donation pit"); ROM lists ground objects by `obj->description` (e.g. "A pit for sacrifices is in front of the altar.") via `format_obj_to_char(obj, ch, fShort=FALSE)`, and skips any object whose description is empty. The `_describe_room` object loop now emits `obj.description` and skips description-less objects (the object analog of the LOOK-001 NPC `long_descr` fix). **Surfaced by the differential testing harness (FINDING-004)** against the `format_obj_to_char` row the `act_info.c` audit had marked "100% PARITY". Regression: `tests/integration/test_look_004_room_object_description.py`. (The aura/stat prefixes — `(Glowing)`/`(Humming)`/`(Invis)`/detect auras — from `format_obj_to_char` remain a separate latent gap.)

## [2.10.4]

### Fixed
- **`MOVE-003` — directional movement no longer emits a non-ROM "You walk &lt;dir&gt; to &lt;room&gt;." line** (ROM `src/act_move.c:204`). ROM `move_char` ends with `do_function(ch, &do_look, "auto")`: the mover sees only the destination room description (others get the `$n leaves`/`$n has arrived` broadcasts), with no "you walk" line. Python's `move_character()` returned `"You walk {dir} to {room}."`, which the dispatcher delivered to the player as an extra line ahead of the auto-look. `move_character` now returns the destination room view (the Python command-output convention, like `do_look`; computed before followers move per ROM order); followers still receive the room via their own message stream. **Surfaced by the differential testing harness (FINDING-003) against a row the `act_move.c` audit had marked "100% parity"** — the audit verified broadcasts/logic but not the mover's own visible output. Regression: `tests/integration/test_move_003_walk_line.py`; ~25 existing assertions across 14 files updated to the ROM-faithful room output.

## [2.10.3]

### Changed
- **`game_tick` world-invariant checker is now opt-in (`@pytest.mark.check_invariants`), not always-on.** The 2.10.0 deployment ran `check_world_invariants` after *every* `game_tick` suite-wide, but the checker walks the GLOBAL `character_registry`/`room_registry`, which the test suite never fully isolates (tests call `initialize_world`, mutate shared `room.people` in place, and leave registered chars behind). That made the checker an intermittent flake generator — an unrelated sibling test would fail depending on xdist worker grouping (observed in `test_group_combat`, then `test_skills_integration`). Investigating confirmed a *fresh* `initialize_world` is fully coherent, so the violations were cross-test pollution, not real bugs. The checker, its `game_tick` hook, and its unit tests are retained; tests now opt in via `@pytest.mark.check_invariants` (the old `no_invariant_check` opt-out marker and three marks added for the always-on rollout were removed). This trades suite-wide free coverage for reliability; per-test opt-in keeps the checker available where a coherent world is guaranteed.

## [2.10.2]

### Fixed
- **`LOOK-002` — `look <mob>` now shows the NPC's description** (ROM `src/act_info.c` `show_char_to_char_1`; `src/db.c` `create_mobile`). `MobInstance` never carried `description` from its prototype, so examining a spawned NPC always printed "You see nothing special about X." instead of ROM's mob description. `MobInstance.from_prototype` now copies `description` (alongside the LOOK-001 `long_descr` fix), mirroring `create_mobile`. Sibling of LOOK-001, found while closing it. Regression: `tests/integration/test_look_long_descr_rom_parity.py::test_look_002_*`.

## [2.10.1]

### Fixed
- **`LOOK-001` — room `look` now shows an NPC's `long_descr`, not its name** (ROM `src/act_info.c` `show_char_to_char_0`). For an NPC whose `position == start_pos` and whose `long_descr` is non-empty, ROM lists it by the long description (e.g. "Hassan is here, waiting to dispense some justice."); Python's `mud/world/look.py` rendered every room occupant via `describe_character` (the PERS/brief path), showing the bare name, and `MobInstance` never carried `long_descr` from its prototype (ROM `create_mobile`, `src/db.c:2040`, copies it). `MobInstance.from_prototype` now copies `long_descr`, and `look.py:_room_occupant_line` implements the long_descr branch (with affect-aura prefixes), falling back to PERS otherwise. **This divergence was surfaced by the new differential testing harness (FINDING-001) against a row the `act_info.c` audit had marked "100% PARITY"** — a concrete example of the per-file audit missing a contract that engine-vs-engine comparison catches. Regression: `tests/integration/test_look_long_descr_rom_parity.py`.

## [2.10.0]

### Added
- **Always-on `game_tick` world-invariant checker** (`mud/diagnostics/invariants.py`). After every `game_tick` during the test suite, `check_world_invariants()` walks the live registries and asserts steady-state ROM structural invariants, turning the suite's `game_tick`-driving tests into continuous parity probes (complementary to the per-INV enforcement tests). v1 asserts **FIGHTING-COHERENCE** (INV-005/006: a fighting character's target is in the same room and not DEAD) and **ROOM-PEOPLE-COHERENCE** (INV-010: `room.people` membership and `char.room` agree in both directions). Wired via a gated hook at the end of `game_tick` (`_INVARIANT_CHECK_ENABLED`, **off in production** — zero live-loop overhead) and an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py`. Tests with intentionally artificial state opt out via `@pytest.mark.no_invariant_check` (three pre-existing tests using `object()` sentinel rooms / deliberately desynced `room.people` were marked; the checker surfaced **zero real bugs**). Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-game-tick-invariant-checker-design.md`. A companion design for a ROM C ⇄ Python differential-testing harness is specced at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-differential-testing-harness-design.md`.

## [2.9.91]

### Fixed
- **xdist isolation leak — `test_flee_moves_character` corrupted a shared world room's `exits`** (test-side only; no production behavior changed). `tests/integration/test_flee_moves_character.py` calls `initialize_world()` (which clears+reloads `room_registry`/`area_registry` from disk) and then sets the *real* registered room 3001's `exits` to a dict (`{"north": {...}}`) to exercise do_flee's dict-format branch — but never restored it. With xdist `--dist loadscope`, the populated registries and the dict-shaped exits leaked to whatever test landed next on the same worker. A later `game_tick()` (e.g. in `tests/integration/test_group_combat.py`) reset the leaked area, and `reset_handler._restore_exit_states` crashed: `enumerate({"north": ...})` yields the string key `"north"`, so `"north".exit_info = 0` raised `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'exit_info'`. Manifested as an intermittent failure of `test_group_xp_split_between_members` whenever worker grouping put the two files together with the leaked area aged ≥3. Added an autouse snapshot-before/restore-after fixture for `room_registry`/`area_registry` in the flee file (AGENTS.md "Parallel test execution & isolation"), discarding the test's corrupted Room objects and returning the registries to their pre-test state.

## [2.9.90]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-018` — combat hit messages now fire mob ACT triggers (TRIG_ACT)** (ROM `src/fight.c:2215-2226`). ROM `dam_message` emits the combat line TO_ROOM (self-inflicted) or TO_NOTVICT (normal) via `act()` with no `MOBtrigger=FALSE` wrap, so per `src/comm.c:2384` every NPC in the room (other than attacker/victim) fires `mp_act_trigger` against the formatted line — mob ACT-progs respond to combat happening around them. Python's `_broadcast_damage_messages` rendered the per-recipient combat text but never dispatched TRIG_ACT, so combat-watching mobprogs silently no-opped. The room broadcast now calls `mp_act_trigger_room(<rendered line>, room, attacker, exclude=victim)`, mirroring the rest of the INV-025 act()-dispatch sweep. Regression: `tests/integration/test_fight_018_dam_message_act_trigger_dispatch.py`.

## [2.9.89]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-017` — WEAPON_POISON now sources its level from a temporary envenom affect and weakens it per hit** (ROM `src/fight.c:605-608, 627-636`). ROM derives the poison `level` from `affect_find(wield->affected, gsn_poison)` — using `poison->level` when a temporary envenom (from `spell_poison` cast on the weapon) is present, else `wield->level` — and after applying the venom weakens a temporary poison each hit: `poison->level = UMAX(0, poison->level - 2)`, `poison->duration = UMAX(0, poison->duration - 1)`, emitting `"The poison on $p has worn off."` to the **wielder** (TO_CHAR) when either reaches 0. Python previously ignored `wield.affected` entirely (always used the weapon level) and never decayed an envenom. The WEAPON_POISON branch in `process_weapon_special_attacks` now scans `wield.affected` for the affect with `spell_name == "poison"`, uses its level (raw, no floor) when present, and weakens it after the save block — independent of whether the victim saved. Permanent WEAPON_POISON weapons (no envenom affect) are unchanged. Regression: `tests/integration/test_weapon_poison_affect.py::test_fight_017_*` (4 cases).

## [2.9.88]

### Added
- **Parallel test execution by default** — added `pytest-xdist` and `addopts = "-n auto --dist loadscope"` to `pyproject.toml`. The full suite now runs in ~94s instead of ~517s (~5.5× faster) on a 10-core machine. Disable for single-test debugging with `pytest -n0`. `--dist loadscope` keeps each module/class on one worker so module-scoped fixtures and per-file global state behave as in serial runs.

### Fixed
- **Test isolation bugs that prevented parallel runs** (surfaced by enabling `pytest -n auto`). All are test-side; no production behavior changed:
  - **Shared SQLite DB across workers** — `mud/db/session.py` builds a module-level engine on a fixed `sqlite:///mud.db`, and several tests `drop_all`/`create_all` on it; concurrent workers wiped each other's tables. `tests/conftest.py` now points `DATABASE_URL` at a per-worker file when `PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER` is set (before the engine is imported).
  - **`registry.descriptor_list` leaking across tests** — `wiznet()` uses `descriptor_list` when non-empty, else falls back to `character_registry`; a net test leaking a populated list flipped a later registry-only test off its delivery path. Added an autouse snapshot/restore in `tests/conftest.py`.
  - **`area_registry` pollution in `test_mpedit_001_interpret_mpedit.py`** — the mpedit security gate resolves the area via `_get_area_for_vnum(100)` (first covering area in insertion order); a sibling world-loader leaking a real area covering vnum 100 tripped "Insufficient security". The file's autouse fixture now snapshots/clears/restores `area_registry`.
  - **`test_movement_npc` global-time dependency** — `room_is_dark()` for an outdoor `WATER_NOSWIM` room falls through to global `time_info.sunlight`; the test passed only when a prior test left it daytime. The rooms are now explicitly lit (lighting is incidental to the NPC-move-cost assertion).
  - **OLC `asave` tests rewrote the repo's `data/areas/area.lst`** — `cmd_asave` ("list"/"world"/"changed") calls `save_area_list()` with its default relative path, so asave tests that didn't redirect it (in `test_olc_save.py`, `test_olc_builders.py`) silently dropped `test.json` from the tracked file on every suite run. Added an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` that redirects only the default `data/areas/area.lst` write to a per-test tmp file (explicit paths pass through).
- **`FIGHT-016` — WEAPON_POISON now applies a timed, STR-reducing poison affect instead of a bare flag** (ROM `src/fight.c:616-624`). On a poisoned-weapon hit where the victim fails the poison save, ROM `affect_join`s a structured affect: `af.level = level*3/4`, `af.duration = level/2`, `af.location = APPLY_STR`, `af.modifier = -1`, `af.bitvector = AFF_POISON`. Python previously called only `victim.add_affect(AffectFlag.POISON)` — an untimed flag that never wore off, applied no STR penalty, and skipped `affect_join` merge semantics. The branch now builds a `SpellEffect(name="poison", level=c_div(level*3,4), duration=c_div(level,2), stat_modifiers={Stat.STR:-1}, affect_flag=AffectFlag.POISON, wear_off_message="You feel less sick.")` and routes it through `Character.apply_spell_effect` (the Python `affect_join` port), matching `spell_poison`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_weapon_poison_affect.py`.
- **`test_weapon_flaming_fire_damage` no longer over-asserts `number_range` call count** — the WEAPON_FLAMING proc legitimately calls `rng_mm.number_range` twice (once for the fire-damage roll, once inside `fire_effect`), but the test pinned `assert_called_once_with(1, 4)` on the shared mock, so it failed in isolation (and only passed under full-suite ordering quirks). Switched to `assert_any_call(1, 4)`, which verifies the flaming damage roll without forbidding `fire_effect`'s internal roll. Test-only; no production change.

### Changed
- Reclassified **`ARITH-004` → ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` — the `max(1, weapon_level)` floor in `process_weapon_special_attacks` is behaviorally dead (every consumer divides the level by ≥2, so `0//N == 1//N`; `weapon_level` is also pre-floored at the shared `_weapon_level(wield) or 1`). Same shape as ARITH-020/021/022/023. The real WEAPON_POISON divergence is now tracked as FIGHT-016 (above) and FIGHT-017. Effective open ARITH ❌ MISSING: 7 → 6.
- Filed **`FIGHT-017`** (`docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md`) — temporary-envenomed-weapon level source (`affect_find(wield->affected, gsn_poison)` → `poison->level` else `wield->level`) + per-hit weakening (`poison->level -= 2`, `duration -= 1`, "worn off" message) per ROM `src/fight.c:605-608, 627-636`. Not yet closed.

## [2.9.87]

### Fixed
- **Equipment-key canonicalization — `Character.equipment` is now keyed strictly by `int(WearLocation.X)` on every path** (ROM `src/handler.c:1733 get_eq_char(ch, int iWear)`; there are no string slot names in ROM). This closes the broader followup left open by INV-028 (2.9.85) and fixes two real, player-visible parity bugs the key-type inconsistency was hiding:
  - **New characters' starting light was uncounted in room lighting.** `give_school_outfit` equips a lit war banner (vnum 3716, `item_type light`, `value[2]=200`) via `Character.equip_object(obj, "light")` — a string key — but `Room._has_lit_light_source` only read `int(WearLocation.LIGHT)`, so every newbie's torch was invisible to room-light accounting.
  - **A shield worn via `do_wear` was invisible to the combat shield check.** `do_wear` stored the shield under `int(WearLocation.SHIELD)` (==11) while `mud/combat/engine.py:_has_shield_equipped` read the string key `"shield"` — so the bash/shield-block logic never saw a normally-worn shield.
- Root cause: `Character.equip_object(obj, slot)` stored its `slot` argument raw, so production callers (`give_school_outfit`, the `floating_disc` spell, the AI agent) seeded the dict with semantic string keys (`"light"`, `"body"`, `"wield"`, `"float"`) while `do_wear` used int keys; readers were split across both conventions, and JSON save/reload turned int keys into stringified-int keys (`"0"`).
- Fix: new `mud.models.constants.canonical_wear_slot(slot)` resolver (accepts an int/IntEnum, a numeric string, or a legacy slot name; raises `ValueError` on anything else) is applied at every write site — `equip_object`, the `from_orm` equipment restore, and `mud/db/serializers.py:_slot_to_wear_loc`. All readers now use the int key: `engine.py` (wield + shield), `inventory.py:give_school_outfit`, `skills/handlers.py` (floating disc + the `portal`/`nexus` HOLD-slot warp-stone lookup), `combat/death.py:_is_floating_slot`, and `commands/compare.py` (this last also fixed a latent bug — `_find_equipped_match` read the non-existent `char.equipped` attribute, so `compare` against a worn weapon silently never matched). The per-reader LIGHT tolerance shims added by INV-028 (`room.py` str-`"0"` fallback, `game_loop.py` `"light"`-name match) were removed. `Character.equipment` retyped `dict[int, Object]`.

### Added
- `tests/test_equipment_key_convention.py` — grep-guard (same pattern as `test_rng_determinism.py`) that fails if any string-literal `equipment["..."]` / `equipment.get("...")` access reappears in `mud/`.
- `tests/integration/test_equip_key_canonical.py` — 3 regression cases: school-outfit light counted in room light; do_wear shield seen by the combat shield check; do_wear→save→load yields the int LIGHT key (not str `"0"`).
- AGENTS.md "Equipment lookup" rule expanded with the int-key contract, the `canonical_wear_slot` write-path detail, and a pointer to the guard test.
- `tests/test_attribute_convention.py` — companion grep-guard banning the AGENTS.md anti-pattern attribute names `.carrying` / `.characters` / `.equipped` (the last surfaced the compare.py latent bug). Pre-commit hooks added for both convention guards in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Changed
- AGENTS.md "Integer math" rule reworded: `c_div`/`c_mod` are required only when an operand **can be negative** (where ROM's truncate-toward-zero diverges from Python's floor); bare `//`/`%` are correct and widely used for provably non-negative operands. The previous blanket "never `//` or `%`" contradicted ~30 legitimate uses and is not grep-enforceable.
- Filed `CLEANUP-001` in `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md` — ~41 hardcoded hex flag literals to migrate to enum references (per-site `merc.h` verification needed; non-blocking).

## [2.9.86]

### Changed
- **Fixed 5 stale unit tests that asserted pre-ARITH-105 stat-floor behavior** (surfaced by running the full `pytest` suite, not just the integration subset). ARITH-105 (2.9.72) changed `Character.get_curr_stat` to floor at 3 (ROM `URANGE(3,...,25)`, `src/handler.c:872`), but these tests still assumed `perm_stat=0` → stat 0. No implementation change — the tests now assert ROM-correct values:
  - `tests/test_player_stats.py::TestStatBoundsAndClamping::test_get_curr_stat_clamps_to_minimum_0` → renamed to `..._minimum_3`; STR/INT debuffed below 3 now read 3, not 0.
  - `tests/test_skill_combat_rom_parity.py` bash size/dodge, disarm differential, and dirt-kicking terrain tests: expected chances recomputed to include the PC's floored STR/DEX (3) where they previously assumed 0. The dirt-kicking test's brittle `assert_called_once()` (incompatible with the success path's `number_range` damage roll) was replaced with a blind-effect success check.

## [2.9.85]

### Fixed
- **`INV-028` — worn lights now land in the `WEAR_LIGHT` slot and burn out / track room light correctly** (ROM `src/act_obj.c:1415-1422`). `do_wear`/`do_hold` previously routed an `ITEM_LIGHT` through the HOLD-flag branch into `WearLocation.HOLD`, while `Room._has_lit_light_source` read the str key `"0"` and `mud/game_loop.py:_find_equipped_light` matched only `"light"`/int-`WearLocation.LIGHT` — three inconsistent keys, so PC light sources never burned out and PC-held lights were mis-counted in room lighting vs ROM. Fix: `do_wear` now has an `item_type == ItemType.LIGHT` branch (before the HOLD branch, mirroring ROM's item-type-first dispatch in `wear_obj`) that equips into `int(WearLocation.LIGHT)` with the "lights $p and holds it" messages; `Room._has_lit_light_source` and `_find_equipped_light` now tolerate both the live `int` key and the reloaded `str "0"` key. This also lets the 2.9.81 ARITH-202 burnout-decrement fix actually take effect in live play. Regression: `tests/integration/test_inv028_light_slot_key_coherence.py` (do_wear → LIGHT slot by key; room.light increments on enter; burnout tick decrements room.light and destroys the torch). Promoted INV-028 candidate → ✅ ENFORCED.

### Changed
- `tests/integration/test_equipment_system.py::test_wear_011_do_hold_auto_replaces_existing_held` now uses non-light holdables (wands) to exercise the HOLD auto-replace mechanic, since lights correctly route to `WEAR_LIGHT` (INV-028).
- **Known followup (not closed by INV-028):** the broader `character.equipment` key-type inconsistency — live `int` slot keys vs reloaded `str` keys for *every* slot — remains open; INV-028 only reconciles the LIGHT slot.

## [2.9.84]

### Changed
- **`INV-028` filed as a candidate cross-file invariant** (LIGHT-SLOT-KEY-COHERENCE) in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`. Surfaced while verifying ARITH-202 reachability: the worn-light equipment slot is keyed three inconsistent ways — `do_wear` stores held lights under `WearLocation.HOLD` (`mud/commands/equipment.py:192`; `_get_wear_location` has no LIGHT branch), `Room._has_lit_light_source` reads the str key `"0"` (`mud/models/room.py:29`), and `_find_equipped_light` matches only `"light"`/int-`WearLocation.LIGHT` (`mud/game_loop.py:357-361`). Net effect vs ROM (`src/act_obj.c:wear_obj` → `WEAR_LIGHT`, read consistently by `src/handler.c:1504-1573` room-light tracking and `src/update.c:721-730` burnout decay): PC light sources never burn out and PC-held lights are mis-tracked in room lighting. The ARITH-202 floor removal is ROM-faithful but its production effect is gated by INV-028. Not yet enforced — proposed fix + regression filename documented in the tracker.

## [2.9.83]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-104` and `ARITH-201` reclassified ❌ MISSING → ⛔ N/A** in the ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY triage (comment-only, no behavior change; verified this session).
  - **ARITH-104** (`mud/world/movement.py:428`) — the `max(0, move_cost // 2)` floor on the FLYING/HASTE movement-cost halving is structurally redundant: every `movement_loss` table value is ≥1, so `move_cost ≥ 1` and `move_cost // 2 ≥ 0` always — the floor can never fire. ROM `src/act_move.c:181` does `move /= 2` raw with the identical result.
  - **ARITH-201** (`mud/game_loop.py:426`) — the carry_weight/number fallback in `_destroy_light` is dead for real objects: every `Object` exposes a `pIndexData` property (`mud/models/object.py:97`), so the `hasattr(obj, "pIndexData")` early-return at `game_loop.py:418-420` always fires and routes through `_extract_obj` → `_remove_from_character` (the ARITH-108/109/205-fixed raw path). Only non-`Object` test doubles reach the floored fallback. ROM `src/handler.c:1678-1679` subtracts raw via obj_from_char.
  - ROM-cite comments added at both sites. Tally: cumulative **21 FIXED / 19 N/A / 7 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.82]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-205` — runtime extract path no longer floors `carry_number` at 0** (ROM `src/handler.c:1678`). Pre-fix `mud/game_loop.py:819` (`_remove_from_character`, the `_extract_obj` carrier branch) used `carry_number = max(0, current_number - slot_cost)`. ROM's `obj_from_char` does `ch->carry_number -= get_obj_number(obj);` raw with no floor, and `extract_obj` (`src/handler.c:2051`) routes through it. The Python floor masked a desynced count; the raw subtraction now exposes it as a negative value (same philosophy as ARITH-107 nplayer / INV-023). carry_weight is re-summed via `_recalculate_carry_weight()` after the subtraction, so INV-011 (CARRY-WEIGHT-COHERENCE) still holds on the in-sync path — the divergence surfaces only on desync. Regression: `tests/integration/test_arith_205_carry_number_no_floor.py` (carry_number 0 + one carried object extracted → −1). INV-011 enforcement suite still green. Tally: cumulative **21 FIXED / 17 N/A / 9 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.81]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-202` — worn-light burnout no longer floors `room.light` at 0** (ROM `src/update.c:726`). Pre-fix `mud/game_loop.py:454` (`_decay_worn_light`) used `room.light = max(0, current_light - 1)` when a worn light burned out. ROM does `--ch->in_room->light;` raw with no floor, so a desynced room light count is allowed to drift negative. The Python floor silently masked the desync; the raw decrement now exposes it (same philosophy as ARITH-107 nplayer / INV-023). Regression: `tests/integration/test_room_light_tracking.py::test_burnout_light_decrement_has_no_floor_exposing_desync` (room.light 0 + worn torch burns out → −1, not floored 0). Tally: cumulative **20 FIXED / 17 N/A / 10 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.80]

### Fixed
- **`GL-024` — level-1 plague affect is now dormant** (ROM `src/update.c:818-819`). ROM's plague tick prints the writhe messages, then does `if (af->level == 1) continue;` — skipping spread, mana/move drain, and `damage()` for a level-1 plague. Python's `_char_update_tick_effects` (`mud/game_loop.py`) gated only the *spread* on `if af_level > 1:`; the drain and `damage()` still ran at level 1, so a level-1 plague kept draining mana/move and dealing disease damage where ROM goes dormant. Fix: moved the drain + `damage()` block inside the `if af_level > 1:` guard. Regression: `tests/integration/test_gl_024_level1_plague_dormant.py` (level-1 plague NPC → mana/move/hit unchanged by the tick). Surfaced during the 2.9.79 ARITH-203/204 close-out. Full integration suite: **2344 passed, 3 skipped** in 85.66s.

## [2.9.79]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-203` / `ARITH-204` — plague-tick mana/move drain no longer floors at 0** (ROM `src/update.c:843-845`). Pre-fix `mud/game_loop.py:626-627` (`_char_update_tick_effects`) used `character.mana = max(0, mana - dam)` and the same for `move`. ROM's plague tick does `dam = UMIN(ch->level, af->level/5 + 1); ch->mana -= dam; ch->move -= dam;` raw — when the character's current mana/move is below `dam` the pools go negative and regenerate back toward zero on the next tick. The Python floor swallowed that negative drift. Both floors removed in one commit (same tick, same ROM line family). Regression: `tests/integration/test_arith_203_204_plague_drain_no_floor.py` (level=10, af.level=10 → dam=3; mana 1 → −2, move 2 → −1). Full integration suite: **2343 passed, 3 skipped** in 82.29s.

### Changed
- **`GL-024` filed as ❌ OPEN** in `docs/parity/UPDATE_C_AUDIT.md`. Surfaced during the ARITH-203/204 close-out: ROM's plague tick at `src/update.c:818-819` does `if (af->level == 1) continue;` — a level-1 plague affect skips the entire spread + mana/move drain + `damage()` block. Python's `_char_update_tick_effects` gates only the *spread* on `if af_level > 1:`, so a level-1 plague keeps draining and dealing damage where ROM goes dormant. Filed per AGENTS.md "out-of-scope bugs surfaced mid-audit" rule; `update.c` subsystem-tracker row annotated with the open follow-up.

## [2.9.78]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-115` — keeper/character wealth helpers no longer floor at 0** (ROM `src/act_obj.c:2747-2748`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/shop.py:462` (`_set_keeper_total_wealth`) and `:473` (`_set_character_total_wealth`) used `total = max(total, 0)` plus Python `//` and `%`. ROM does `keeper->gold += cost * number / 100; keeper->silver += cost * number - (cost * number / 100) * 100;` raw — when `cost` is negative (the ARITH-111 player-refund branch on `shop.profit_buy < 50` custom shops with a winning haggle roll), keeper gold/silver are allowed to drift below zero. ROM has no keeper-side safety net; the only clamp is `deduct_cost`'s end-of-function rebalance at `src/handler.c:2412-2421` which applies to the *character*, and which Python's `deduct_cost` already mirrors at `mud/handler.py:918-923`. The Python floor silently swallowed the refund-side loss. Floors removed from both helpers; `//`/`%` switched to `c_div`/`c_mod` so negative totals split ROM-faithfully (e.g. `cost = -9 → gold = 0, silver = -9`, matching ROM's incremental adds). Regression: `tests/integration/test_arith_115_keeper_wealth_no_floor.py` (profit_buy=40, cost=100, roll=99, keeper starts at 0 wealth → drifts to −9). Full integration suite: **2342 passed, 3 skipped** in 87.45s. Tally adjusted: cumulative **17 FIXED / 17 N/A / 13 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.77]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-111` — item-shop haggle no longer floors `unit_price` at 0** (ROM `src/act_obj.c:2722-2729`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/shop.py:822` used `unit_price = max(0, unit_price - discount)`. ROM does `cost -= obj->cost / 2 * roll / 100;` raw — when `shop.profit_buy < 50` (custom area shops) and the haggle roll wins, the discount exceeds `unit_price` and `cost` goes negative. `deduct_cost(ch, negative_cost)` at ROM `src/handler.c:2397-2422` then refunds the player: `silver = UMIN(ch->silver, cost) = cost` (negative), `silver < cost` is false so gold stays 0, then `ch->silver -= silver` adds `|cost|` to the player's purse. Python's `deduct_cost` at `mud/handler.py:885` already mirrors that arithmetic; only the upstream clamp blocked the divergence. Floor removed with ROM-cite comment. Regression: `tests/integration/test_arith_111_haggle_no_floor.py` (profit_buy=40, cost=100, roll=99 → unit_price = 40 − 49 = −9; player wealth 100 → 109). Full integration suite: **2341 passed, 3 skipped** in 89.17s.

### Changed
- **`ARITH-115` filed as ❌ MISSING** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` (row 32). Surfaced during ARITH-111 close-out: keeper-side bookkeeping at `mud/commands/shop.py:462` (`_set_keeper_total_wealth` clamps `total` at 0) and the companion `_set_character_total_wealth` floor at line 474 do not match ROM `src/act_obj.c:2747-2748`, which lets `keeper->gold` / `keeper->silver` drift negative on the refund path. Held back from the ARITH-111 commit because (a) it bites only on a narrower sub-condition (`|negative total_cost| > keeper current wealth`) and (b) it touches two helpers used by both buy and sell paths — needs its own focused regression test rather than being bundled. Tally adjusted: **16 FIXED / 17 N/A / 14 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage (47 total: 45 triaged + ARITH-024 post-triage + ARITH-114 + ARITH-115 follow-ons).

## [2.9.76]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-020`/`ARITH-021`/`ARITH-022`/`ARITH-023` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` — level-0 spell/skill dice cluster, all dead defensive code:
  - **ARITH-020** — `mud/skills/handlers.py:3744` `rng_mm.dice(1, max(1, level))` in `spell_energy_drain`. ROM `src/magic.c:2727` does `dice(1, level)` raw. The Python floor protects against `level == 0`, but spell dispatch is always `do_cast → spell_fun(sn, ch->level, ...)` with a level/class gate, so a level-0 caster is structurally impossible. (Side note: ROM `dice(1, 0)` returns 0 via `size == 0` short-circuit in src/db.c, which differs from Python's `dice(1, 1) = 1` — divergence exists but the input is unreachable.)
  - **ARITH-021** — `mud/skills/handlers.py:4127` `max(0, level - 2)` in `spell_fire_breath`. ROM `src/magic.c:4701` passes `level - 2` raw to `saves_spell`. fire_breath is dispatched only via the `spec_breath_fire` spec_fun, attached exclusively to high-level dragon mobs; level < 2 is structurally unreachable. `saves_spell` handles negative level arithmetically without crashing.
  - **ARITH-022** — `mud/skills/handlers.py:4517` `max(0, level - 2)` in `spell_frost_breath`. ROM `src/magic.c:4759`. Same reasoning as ARITH-021 — `spec_breath_frost` on dragon mobs only.
  - **ARITH-023** — `mud/skills/handlers.py:5518` `max(1, int(...level))` in `do_kick`. ROM `src/fight.c:3129` does `number_range(1, ch->level)` raw. `do_kick` requires `ch->fighting != NULL` plus a `gsn_kick` skill check — level-0 characters cannot reach the site. Additionally, ROM `number_range(1, 0)` returns `from = 1` via the `to < from` branch in src/db.c, identical to the Python floor even if reached.

  ROM-cite comments added at all four sites documenting unreachability. No production behavior change — comments-only edits + audit reclass. Tally adjusted: cumulative **15 FIXED / 17 N/A / 14 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.75]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-107` — `Room.remove_character` no longer floors `area.nplayer` at 0** (ROM `src/handler.c:1502`). Pre-fix `mud/models/room.py:171` used `max(0, current - 1)`. ROM does bare `--ch->in_room->area->nplayer` with no floor, intentionally letting the counter go negative when a non-NPC leaves a room whose area-counter was already 0. A negative `nplayer` is ROM's way of surfacing desync bugs from code paths that mutate `room.people` directly (see INV-023 — `do_recall` and several admin/imm paths bypass the canonical helpers in shipped ROM areas too). The Python floor silently absorbed that desync, hiding bugs that ROM would expose via repop / area-age divergence in `src/db.c:1617-1630`. Floor removed; the existing `if char in self.people:` guard still prevents a bare `room.remove_character(non-present-char)` from decrementing. Regression: `tests/integration/test_arith_107_nplayer_no_floor.py` (3 cases: negative-on-desync, NPC-skip, balanced-add-remove). Full integration suite: **2340 passed, 3 skipped**. Tally adjusted: cumulative **15 FIXED** / 13 N/A / **18 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.74]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-106`/`ARITH-108`/`ARITH-109`/`ARITH-112`/`ARITH-113` — `obj_from_char` no longer floors `carry_weight`/`carry_number` at 0** (ROM `src/handler.c:1678-1679`). ROM does `ch->carry_number -= get_obj_number(obj)` and `ch->carry_weight -= get_obj_weight(obj)` raw with no floor and no upstream guard. Pre-fix Python wrapped both subtractions in `max(0, ...)` at five sites, silently absorbing double-extract / over-subtract corruption that ROM would surface as a negative carry counter. All five floors removed:
  - `mud/models/character.py:580` (ARITH-106 — `Character.remove_object` carry_number; `_recalculate_carry_weight` continues to handle the weight side via fresh sum)
  - `mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py:638-639` (ARITH-108/109 — `_obj_from_char` carry_weight + carry_number)
  - `mud/commands/consumption.py:347,350` (ARITH-112/113 — `_destroy_object` carry_weight + carry_number)
  Regression: `tests/integration/test_obj_from_char_no_floor.py` (3 cases). Full integration suite: **2337 passed, 3 skipped**. Tally adjusted: cumulative 14 FIXED / 13 N/A / **19 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage.

## [2.9.73]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-110` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` — dead defensive code. Pet-shop haggle at `mud/commands/shop.py:586` uses `max(0, cost - discount)`. ROM `src/act_obj.c:2605` does `cost -= cost / 2 * roll / 100` raw with no floor. Reachability analysis: `discount = c_div(c_div(cost, 2) * roll, 100)` with `roll ∈ [0, 99]`; the inner `c_div(cost, 2) * roll` is at most `c_div(cost, 2) * 99`, so `discount ≤ c_div(c_div(cost, 2) * 99, 100) < c_div(cost, 2)`. Therefore `cost - discount > cost - c_div(cost, 2) ≥ 0` for all `cost ≥ 0` — the `max(0, ...)` floor cannot fire. Same shape as the dead-defensive-code reclassifications in 2.9.67/68/69 (ARITH-006/007/008/013/014). ROM-cite comment added at `mud/commands/shop.py:582-590`. No production behavior change — comment-only edit + audit reclass. Tally adjusted: 56 ✅ / 36 ❌ / **123 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **24**.
- **ARITH-111 left ❌ MISSING** with documented reachability conditions. Unlike ARITH-110, the item-shop branch at `mud/commands/shop.py:822` computes `discount` from `obj->cost` (the unmarked-up proto cost) but applies it to the marked-up `unit_price = obj->cost * profit_buy / 100`. **Reachable** when `profit_buy < 50` (custom area shops), because then `unit_price < proto.cost / 2 ≤ max possible discount`. ROM allows `cost` to go negative; Python clamps to 0. A clean close requires understanding the `deduct_cost` interaction when cost is negative — held back for a future targeted session.

## [2.9.72]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-105` — `Character.get_curr_stat` now floors at 3** (ROM `src/handler.c:872`). Pre-fix `mud/models/character.py:478` used `max(0, min(25, total))`. ROM uses `URANGE(3, ch->perm_stat[stat] + ch->mod_stat[stat], max)` — minimum stat is **3**, never 0. Pre-fix, stacked debuffs (e.g. weaken, chill_touch, plague tick, cursed equipment) could drive a character's effective STR/INT/WIS/DEX/CON to 0–2, feeding wrong-row reads of `str_app` (hit/dam), `dex_app` (defensive AC, save-vs-spell, carry), `con_app` (HP gain on level), `int_app` (learn rate), `wis_app` (practice gain on level), and the `_STR_WIELD` carry/wield ladders. ROM bug-walled the floor at 3 specifically so those tables never need the 0-2 rows in PC stat-space (they exist as defensive padding only). Side-effect: a CON-0 PC test (`test_advancement_con_app::test_advance_level_hp_minimum_floor_is_two`) that was reaching the `UMAX(2, add_hp)` defensive floor in `advance_level` via the buggy floor was updated to verify the floor via monkeypatch of `con_hitp_bonus` — the floor remains dead in stock-class PC space (lowest add_hp is now `(con_app[3].hitp + mage.hp_min) * 9/10 = 3`) but is kept for future-class / save-corruption safety, matching ROM. Regression: `tests/integration/test_get_curr_stat_floor_three.py` (17 parametrized cases across STR/INT/WIS/DEX/CON × heavily-debuffed / exactly-zero / already-3 / positive-buff / ceiling). Test suite: 2334 passed, 3 skipped.
- **Ceiling divergence filed as `ARITH-114`** (new) at `mud/models/character.py:478`. Python clamps to a flat 25; ROM clamps to per-race/class `max_stat` (`src/handler.c:861-869`) for PCs and only 25 for NPCs/immortals. Not in scope for this commit — tracked for future close-out. Tally adjusted: cumulative 9 FIXED / 12 N/A / **25 ❌ MISSING** open in the ARITH triage after ARITH-105 close + ARITH-114 file.

## [2.9.71]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-209` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` — dead defensive code on shipped ROM areas. Spot-check confirmed ROM does not floor `arg4` for P resets: `src/db.c:1040-1044 load_resets` reads it raw via `fread_number(fp)`, and `src/db.c:1788 reset_room` uses it raw in `while (count < pReset->arg4)` (so `arg4 == 0` is a legitimate no-op in ROM). Audit of all 77 P resets in shipped `area/*.are` files: every one uses `arg4 == 1`; none use `arg4 == 0`. Both Python floors (`mud/loaders/json_loader.py:357-359` and `mud/spawning/reset_handler.py:665`) are unreachable on shipped data. The inaccurate comment at `json_loader.py:357` ("mirrors ROM's max(1, arg4)") — flagged as needs-followup in the original triage — was replaced with an accurate ROM-cite at both sites noting the floors are unreachable on shipped data and only affect custom areas that explicitly request `arg4 == 0`. No production behavior change — comments-only edits + audit reclass. Tally adjusted: 57 ✅ / **36 ❌** / **122 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **26**.

## [2.9.70]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-005` — `xp_compute` no longer floors `gch_level` to 1** (ROM `src/fight.c:1818-1819`). Pre-fix `mud/groups/xp.py:130` used `max(1, _resolve_level(getattr(gch, "level", 0)))`. ROM uses `gch->level` raw and relies on the final `xp = xp * gch->level / UMAX(1, total_levels - 1)` to return 0 naturally for a level-0 PC. The floor masked that path: a level-0 PC reaching `xp_compute` was treated as level-1, getting non-zero XP and consuming a shifted row of the `base_exp` table (`level_range = victim_level - 1` vs ROM's `victim_level - 0`). Reachability is real: `Character` dataclass defaults `level: int = 0` (`mud/models/character.py:229`), `create_character_record(level=0)` persists rows with level 0, and the second loop in `group_gain` only skips NPCs, so a level-0 PC in the kill room reaches `xp_compute`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_xp_compute_level_zero_pc.py::test_level_zero_pc_receives_zero_xp_in_xp_compute` (pinned to 0 XP) and `::test_level_one_pc_unchanged_after_fix` (sanity guard for the level-1 boundary). Tally adjusted: 57 ✅ / **37 ❌** / **121 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **27**.

## [2.9.69]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-014` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` — dead defensive code (same shape as ARITH-006/007/008/013). The `max(1, multiplier * rating * 4)` floor at `mud/skills/registry.py:330` cannot fire: the upstream `if rating <= 0: return` at `:326-327` mirrors ROM's `skill_table[sn].rating[ch->class] == 0` early-return at `src/skills.c:932`, and every `check_improve` call site across `mud/combat/engine.py`, `mud/commands/*`, `mud/skills/handlers.py`, and `mud/game_loop.py` passes `multiplier >= 1` (default 1; observed values 1/2/3/4/5/6/8). So `multiplier * rating * 4 >= 4` at line 330 always, and the floor is unreachable — no behavioral divergence from ROM `src/skills.c:938`. ROM-cite comment added at `mud/skills/registry.py:329-333`. No production behavior change — comment-only edit + audit reclass. Tally adjusted: 56 ✅ / **38 ❌** / **121 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **28**.

## [2.9.68]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-001`/`ARITH-002`/`ARITH-003` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` under the `docs/divergences/UB_DIVISORS.md` policy. The `max(1, max_hit)` divisor floors at `mud/mobprog.py:1108` (mob-program `hpcnt` check, ROM `src/mob_cmds.c`), `mud/mobprog.py:1651` (mob-program HPCT trigger), and `mud/combat/messages.py:115` (`dam_message` severity tier lookup, ROM `src/fight.c:dam_message`) are deliberate divergences from ROM, not parity gaps. ROM divides `current * 100 / max_hit` raw in all three sites and tolerates the SIGFPE on degenerate mob data because it kills only one process; Python cannot raise `ZeroDivisionError` inside the game loop without dropping every connected player. All three are NPC-reachable: `mud/spawning/templates.py:170-172` floors `_roll_dice` at 0 (not 1), so a mob proto with `hit_dice = (0,0,0)` spawns with `max_hit == 0`, and the `getattr(..., 1)` default only fires when the attribute is missing entirely — not when it's literally 0. Floors are kept and ROM-cited at all three sites. No production behavior change — comments + audit reclass only. Tally adjusted: 56 ✅ / **39 ❌** / **120 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **29**.

## [2.9.67]

### Changed
- **`ARITH-006`/`ARITH-007`/`ARITH-008` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md`. The `max(1, total_levels)` floors in the three alignment branches of `xp_compute` (`mud/groups/xp.py:166/170/174`) are dead defensive code, not active divergences. The upstream guard at `mud/groups/xp.py:111-112` already floors `total_levels` to `max(1, ch.level)` before any call to `xp_compute` at :117, so the inner floors are unreachable. Same shape as ARITH-013 (post-gate dead code) — no behavioral divergence from ROM `src/fight.c:1892`/`:1900`/`:1908`. ROM-cite comment added at the three sites pointing to the audit rows. Tally adjusted: 56 ✅ / **39 ❌** / **120 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **32**.
- **`ARITH-011` and `ARITH-012` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md`, and a new policy doc `docs/divergences/UB_DIVISORS.md` was added covering both. The `max(1, max_hit)` floors at `mud/commands/combat.py:512` (`do_berserk` hp_percent) and `:636` (`do_flee` hp_percent) are deliberate divergences from ROM (`src/fight.c:2310` and `src/act_move.c` do_flee), not parity gaps. ROM divides `100 * ch->hit / ch->max_hit` raw — SIGFPE if `max_hit == 0`. ROM tolerates this because SIGFPE kills one process; Python cannot, because a `ZeroDivisionError` propagating up through the dispatcher would crash the game loop for every connected player. Reachability probe: PCs always initialize `max_hit ≥ 20` (`mud/models/character.py:951-976`), so do_berserk is unreachable in steady-state PC play; do_flee is genuinely reachable for NPCs because `_roll_dice` at `mud/spawning/templates.py:170-172` floors at 0 (not 1) and a mob proto with `hit_dice = (0,0,0)` will spawn with `max_hit == 0`. Floors are kept and ROM-cited; the new policy doc defines how the same evaluation applies to ARITH-001/002/003/005/006/007/008/014. Regressions: `tests/test_arith_max_hit_floor.py::TestMaxHitFloorDivergence::test_berserk_with_zero_max_hit_does_not_raise` and `::test_flee_with_zero_max_hit_does_not_raise`. Tally adjusted: 56 ✅ / **42 ❌** / **117 N/A**. Effective open ❌ MISSING in the ARITH triage drops to **35**.

## [2.9.66]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-101`/`ARITH-102`/`ARITH-103` — `create_money` weights now match ROM raw integer division** (ROM `src/handler.c:2455`/`:2465`/`:2477`). Pre-fix `mud/handler.py:995/1003/1011` used `max(1, gold // 5)`, `max(1, silver // 20)`, and `max(1, gold // 5 + silver // 20)` respectively. ROM uses `gold / 5`, `silver / 20`, and `gold / 5 + silver / 20` raw — so 1–4 gold coins, 1–19 silver coins, and small mixed stacks weigh **0** in ROM, not 1. Carry-weight accounting on dropped/given/looted coin piles is now exact. Replaced with `c_div(...)`; added function-local import of `c_div` (style matches the function's other lazy imports). Regression: `tests/integration/test_money_objects.py::test_create_money_weight_matches_rom_raw_division` (parametrized across 9 cases — three branches × {below-floor, at-floor, above-floor}). Three sibling ARITH-NNN rows flipped to ✅ FIXED in one commit because the divergence is one ROM function across three branches.
- **`ARITH-024` — `group_gain` delivers XP message and calls `gain_exp` unconditionally** (ROM `src/fight.c:1786-1789`). Pre-fix `mud/groups/xp.py:117-122` had `if xp <= 0: continue` which silently dropped the "You receive 0 experience points." message and skipped the `gain_exp(gch, 0)` call when `xp_compute` returned 0 (reachable when `level_range < -9` or outside the base_exp table). ROM's `group_gain` loop is unconditional — both the `sprintf`/`send_to_char` and `gain_exp` calls always fire. Replaced the early-continue with the linear path that ROM uses. `_drop_alignment_conflicts(ch)` still runs after each member, matching ROM's unconditional anti-alignment zap loop at `fight.c:1791-1806`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_character_advancement.py::test_group_gain_zero_xp_still_delivers_message_and_gain_exp`. Surfaced during ARITH-009 reclass analysis.

### Changed
- **`ARITH-009` reclassified to ⛔ N/A** in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md`. The `max(0, xp)` floor at `mud/groups/xp.py:257` is unreachable defensive code — `xp_compute`'s arithmetic has no path to a negative result. The audit prose's "negative XP via alignment math" claim was a misdiagnosis: alignment math mutates `gch.alignment`, it does not feed back into xp. The real divergence the original triage was groping at lives one frame up in `group_gain`'s `xp <= 0` gate, now tracked as ARITH-024.

## [2.9.65]

### Fixed
- **`ARITH-015` — `berserk` duration matches ROM number_fuzzy distribution** (ROM `src/fight.c:2333`). Same distribution-shift bug as ARITH-016 but in the berserk affect path. Pre-fix `mud/skills/handlers.py:1445` had `base = max(1, c_div(level, 8))` then `number_fuzzy(base)`; ROM passes `ch->level / 8` raw. For levels 0–7 ROM passes 0 and gets deterministic duration 1; pre-fix Python passed 1 and gave duration 2 in 25% of low-level berserks. Replaced with `rng_mm.number_fuzzy(c_div(level, 8))`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_berserk_duration.py::test_berserk_passes_raw_level_div_8_to_number_fuzzy`. **Audit note correction:** ARITH-015's original triage note claimed 0-duration; corrected.
- **`ARITH-016` — `charm_person` duration matches ROM number_fuzzy distribution** (ROM `src/magic.c:1383`). Pre-fix `mud/skills/handlers.py:2121` had `base_duration = max(1, c_div(level, 4))` then `number_fuzzy(base_duration)`. ROM passes `level / 4` raw to `number_fuzzy`, which already clamps its return to `UMAX(1, ...)` (ROM `src/db.c:3496`). For levels 0–3 (achievable via low-level caster, scroll, wand, or mob-program path) the pre-fix outer `max(1, ...)` passed 1 instead of 0, shifting 25% of low-level charm casts from duration 1 to duration 2 (the roll=3 branch in `number_fuzzy`). Replaced with `rng_mm.number_fuzzy(c_div(level, 4))`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_charm_person_duration.py::test_charm_person_passes_raw_level_div_4_to_number_fuzzy`. **Audit note correction:** ARITH-016's original triage note claimed ROM gives 0-duration; that was wrong — number_fuzzy's UMAX guarantees ≥1. The audit row now reflects the corrected behavior.
- **`ARITH-010` — `do_practice` no longer floors skill increment to 1** (ROM `src/act_info.c:2772-2774`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/advancement.py:174` used `max(1, gain_rate // max(1, rating))`, so a low-INT character practising a high-rating skill always advanced learned% by at least 1 even when ROM's raw integer division `int_app[INT].learn / skill_table[sn].rating[class]` rounded to 0. Replaced with `c_div(gain_rate, rating)`; the outer `max(1, ...)` is gone. The `rating > 0` precondition (`act_info.c:2752-2755`, mirrored at `advancement.py:162-163`) guarantees no division-by-zero. Practice is still decremented when increment is 0 (ROM `act_info.c:2771`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_do_practice_command.py::test_practice_low_int_high_rating_skill_yields_zero_increment`. First ARITH-NNN gap closed; flips the audit row in `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` to ✅ FIXED.

## [2.9.64]

### Added
- **META Class 2 ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY — triage complete.** New audit doc `docs/parity/audits/ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` covering 215 candidate sites (defensive floors and caps in `mud/`: `max(1,...)`, `max(0,...)`, `min(N,...)`). Triaged via 3 parallel sonnet subagents (combat/skills/groups area = 134 sites; handler/world/models/equipment area = 31 sites; loop/loaders/spawning/rng area = 50 sites). Tally: **56 ✅ MATCH, 45 ❌ MISSING (gap candidates), 114 N/A**. Each ❌ row received a stable gap ID for future close-out: ARITH-001..023 (batch A), ARITH-101..113 (batch B), ARITH-201..209 (batch C). Prioritised list in the doc covers high-impact (ARITH-010 practice-increment floor, ARITH-013 mana-cost divisor, ARITH-015/016 berserk/charm 0-duration, ARITH-009 negative-XP swallow, ARITH-105 `get_curr_stat` floor of 0 vs ROM 3, ARITH-101/102/103 coin-weight inflation), medium-impact (level-0 spell edges; plague-tick mana/move floors; shop haggle floors), low-impact UB-protection (max_hit=0 / total_levels=0 div-by-zero shields), and carry-accounting underflow floors. **6 of 8 META classes are now complete or triaged** (Class 1 BROADCAST_COVERAGE complete, Class 2 ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY triaged this session, Class 7 PARALLEL_REPRESENTATIONS complete, Class 8 MATH_AND_RNG MATH-001 closed; Classes 3/4/5/6 untriaged).

## [2.9.63]

### Fixed
- **`STEAL-001` — `_steal_failure` TO_VICT and TO_NOTVICT broadcasts now reach live sockets** (ROM `src/act_obj.c:2222-2223`). Pre-fix the failure-path acts (`$n tried to steal from you.` and `$n tried to steal from $N.`) only appended to the test-fallback `.messages` list, so connected players saw nothing on a failed steal. New `_send_to_char_sync` helper in `mud/commands/thief_skills.py` fires `asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))` for connected players and falls back to `.messages` for tests. TO_VICT routes through that helper; TO_NOTVICT routes through a `room.people` loop excluding `{char, victim}`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_steal_broadcasts.py` (1/1). **Closes BCAST-038.**
- **`GROUP-001` — `do_group` add and remove broadcasts now reach live sockets** (ROM `src/act_comm.c:1842-1854`). Pre-fix both `$N joins $n's group.` / `You join $n's group.` and the remove-from-group equivalents only appended to `.messages`. Same `_send_to_char_sync` pattern as STEAL-001 routed through both add (act_comm.c:1850-1854) and remove (:1842-1846) branches. Regression: `tests/integration/test_group_broadcasts.py` (2/2). **Closes BCAST-009.**
- **`ORDER-001` — `do_order` TO_VICT now routes through `act()`-equivalent visibility gating** (ROM `src/act_comm.c:1752-1754`). Pre-fix Python formatted `f"{char.name} orders you to '…'"` manually, leaking wiz-invis orderer names to low-trust charmed followers. New `_pers_gated(actor, viewer)` helper mirrors ROM `src/handler.c:pers` — returns `"someone"` when `can_see_character(viewer, actor)` fails, else the actor's name. Both all-targets and single-target branches build `order_message` via the gated helper and deliver through `_send_to_char_sync`. Also fixed a pre-existing bug: the old `send_to_char(order_message, victim)` call had arguments reversed and was never awaited. The audit's secondary claim ("Python checks the wrong word position for the mob guard") was incorrect — Python's `command.split(None, 1)[0]` IS the second word of the original input (ROM's `arg2`); no fix needed there. Regression: `tests/integration/test_order_broadcasts.py` (2/2). **Closes BCAST-017.**

### Changed
- **Class 1 META BROADCAST_COVERAGE burn-down — COMPLETE.** Every row in `docs/parity/audits/BROADCAST_COVERAGE.md` is now ✅ FIXED or ✅ COVERED. The three remaining ⚠️ Partial-blocked rows from 2.9.62 (BCAST-009, -017, -038) all closed this session. INV-027 ACT-INVIS-TRUST-GATE is now the natural next-up (the `_pers_gated` helper introduced for ORDER-001 is a stepping-stone toward the wider `_can_witness(actor, witness)` thread-through).

## [2.9.62]

### Changed
- **Class A BCAST burn-down probe — 13 rows reclassified to ✅ COVERED, 3 narrowed to ⚠️ Partial with new gap IDs** (no code change). Per-row probe pass over the 16 remaining Class 1 BCAST rows (`docs/parity/audits/BROADCAST_COVERAGE.md`). Verified-COVERED via helper-transitivity (same pattern as BCAST-001/004/005/007/008/019/020/026/029 collapses):
  - BCAST-006 (`enter` → `move_character_through_portal`), BCAST-010 (`gtell` → `send_to_char` group-member loop), BCAST-021/022/023/024 (position commands `rest`/`sit`/`sleep`/`stand` → local `_broadcast` → `broadcast_room`), BCAST-028 (`value` — ROM has no TO_ROOM), BCAST-031 (`buy` → `room.broadcast`), BCAST-032 (`force` → `_send_to_char` per branch — ROM has no TO_ROOM), BCAST-033 (`give` → `_broadcast_to_room_observers` + `send_to_char` task), BCAST-036 (`recall` → 3× `room.broadcast`), BCAST-037 (`sell` → `room.broadcast`), BCAST-039 (`transfer` → 2× `_act_room` + `_send_to_char`).
- **Three narrowed Partials surface real divergences** filed durably as new gap IDs in `BROADCAST_COVERAGE.md` Blocked rows:
  - **`GROUP-001`** — `do_group` TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT delivered via `.messages` list only (test fallback, not real-time `send_to_char`/`broadcast_room`); blocks BCAST-009.
  - **`ORDER-001`** — `do_order` bypasses `act()` visibility gating (manual `f"{char.name} orders…"`) and checks the wrong word position for the "mob" guard; blocks BCAST-017 (broadcast delivery itself is correct).
  - **`STEAL-001`** — `_steal_failure` TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT delivered via `.messages` list only; blocks BCAST-038.

### Added
- **`BCAST-002` (mob branch) — `do_clone` mob branch now emits the ROM TO_ROOM broadcast** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2450`). Pre-fix the mob branch placed the clone silently after the CLONE-001 trust-gate fix landed. Added TO_ROOM `$n has created $N.` after the clone is placed in `char.room`, using a `clone.short_descr` → `prototype.short_descr` → `name` fallback chain (same pattern as BCAST-014/015 since spawned MobInstances populate `name` from the prototype's `short_descr`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_clone_broadcasts.py::test_clone_mob_emits_to_room_broadcast`. **Completes BCAST-002** — both branches now ✅ FIXED.

### Fixed
- **`CLONE-001` — `do_clone` mob branch trust gate now imports valid level constants and matches ROM ladder** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2424-2429`, `merc.h:162-170`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/imm_search.py:do_clone` mob branch imported `LEVEL_AVATAR`/`LEVEL_DEMI`/`LEVEL_GOD` from `mud.models.constants` where only `LEVEL_IMMORTAL`/`LEVEL_ANGEL` existed, so every `clone <mob>` call ImportError'd before reaching the spawn or broadcast. Added `LEVEL_AVATAR=52`, `LEVEL_DEMI=54`, `LEVEL_IMMORTAL_TIER=55`, `LEVEL_GOD=56` to `mud/models/constants.py` (the existing `LEVEL_IMMORTAL=52` threshold is left untouched — ROM defines two semantically distinct constants with similar names: a "any immortal" threshold and a specific tier, and Python's `LEVEL_IMMORTAL` matches the former). Updated the gate to use `LEVEL_IMMORTAL_TIER` for the `mob_level > 10` rung (ROM `IMMORTAL=55`, not the threshold), use `LEVEL_ANGEL` for `mob_level > 0` (was incorrectly `LEVEL_AVATAR`), and add the unconditional `IS_TRUSTED(AVATAR)` floor that ROM enforces but Python had been missing. Regression: `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py::test_clone_mob_success_no_import_error_and_places_clone`. **Unblocks BCAST-002 mob branch** (broadcast wiring still pending).

### Added
- **`BCAST-030` — `bash` skill handler now emits all 4 ROM TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT broadcasts** (ROM `src/fight.c:2459-2465` success, `:2478-2481` failure). Pre-fix `mud/skills/handlers.py:bash` ran damage and position changes silently; only the actor's TO_CHAR text was produced via the damage pipeline. Added: success TO_VICT `$n sends you sprawling with a powerful bash!`, success TO_NOTVICT `$n sends $N sprawling with a powerful bash.`, failure TO_NOTVICT `$n falls flat on $s face.`, failure TO_VICT `You evade $n's bash, causing $m to fall flat on $s face.`. New `_objective_pronoun` helper (him/her/it for `$m`); reused existing `_possessive_pronoun` for `$s`. New `_to_vict_send` and `_notvict_broadcast` delivery helpers (the latter mirrors the imm_load.py pattern with a two-actor exclude). Regression: `tests/integration/test_bash_broadcasts.py` (2/2).
- **`BCAST-035` — `do_purge` now emits ROM TO_ROOM and TO_NOTVICT broadcasts on all 3 paths** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2605, 2633, 2645`). Pre-fix room-purge / PC-disintegrate / NPC-purge each returned "Ok." silently. Added `broadcast_room` for room-purge `$n purges the room!`, and a new local `_notvict_broadcast` helper (mirrors `broadcast_room` but supports a two-actor exclude set, since ROM TO_NOTVICT skips both the actor and the about-to-be-extracted victim) for `$n disintegrates $N.` and `$n purges $N.`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_purge_broadcasts.py` (2/2).
- **`BCAST-034` — `do_pick` now emits ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts on all 3 paths** (ROM `src/act_move.c:907, 945, 981`). Pre-fix portal/container returned "You pick the lock on $obj." and door returned "*Click*" — bystanders saw nothing. Added `broadcast_room` for each branch: portal/container `$n picks the lock on $p.`, door `$n picks the $d.` (with `$d` substitution via `_door_keyword`). Regression: `tests/integration/test_pick_broadcasts.py` (2/2).

## [2.9.61]

### Added
- **`BCAST-014` — `do_mload` now emits the ROM TO_ROOM broadcast** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2512`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/imm_load.py:do_mload` returned "Ok." and ran the wiznet log without informing the room that a mob had appeared. Added `broadcast_room(room, f"{actor_name} has created {victim_short}!", exclude=char)` after the spawn/placement, with a `victim.short_descr` → `prototype.short_descr` → `victim.name` fallback chain since spawned MobInstances populate `name` from the prototype's `short_descr` and don't separately carry `short_descr`. Regression: `tests/integration/test_mload_oload_broadcasts.py::test_mload_emits_to_room_broadcast_with_victim_short_descr`.
- **`BCAST-015` — `do_oload` now emits the ROM TO_ROOM broadcast** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2566`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/imm_load.py:do_oload` placed the object and ran the wiznet log silently. Added the TO_ROOM `$n has created $p!` emit after placement with the same `short_descr` → `prototype.short_descr` → `name` fallback chain as BCAST-014. Regression: `tests/integration/test_mload_oload_broadcasts.py::test_oload_emits_to_room_broadcast_with_obj_short_descr`.
- **`BCAST-002` (obj branch) — `do_clone` object branch now emits the ROM TO_ROOM broadcast** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2406`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/imm_search.py:do_clone` returned `"You clone $p."` silently. Added TO_ROOM `$n has created $p.` after the inventory/room placement, before the wiznet log. Regression: `tests/integration/test_clone_broadcasts.py::test_clone_object_emits_to_room_broadcast`. Mob branch (ROM `:2450`) deferred — blocked by newly-filed **CLONE-001** (do_clone mob branch's trust gate imports non-existent `LEVEL_AVATAR`/`LEVEL_DEMI`/`LEVEL_GOD` constants from `mud.models.constants`; ImportErrors before reaching the broadcast point). See `docs/parity/audits/BROADCAST_COVERAGE.md` "Blocked rows" for the CLONE-001 fix shape.

### Changed
- **`BCAST-019` — `do_reply` reclassified to ✅ COVERED** (no code change). Probe confirmed `mud/commands/communication.py:do_reply` is a five-line dispatcher that delegates to `do_tell(char, f"{target.name} {args}")`; the ROM TO_VICT `$n tells you '$t'` broadcast (`src/act_comm.c:946-947`) is already emitted by `do_tell`'s per-victim path. Same helper-transitivity false-positive pattern as the BCAST-001/004/005/007/008/020/026/029 collapses earlier in the burn-down.

### Fixed
- **`WIZLOAD-001` — wiz-load/clone command surface now functional** (four layered pre-existing typos that left `do_mload`, `do_oload`, and `do_clone` object branch wholly unreachable on real prototypes). `mud/commands/imm_load.py` now reads `registry.mob_registry`/`obj_registry` (was: non-existent `*_prototypes`) and calls `spawn_object(vnum)` then sets `obj.level = level` post-spawn (was: non-existent `spawn_obj(vnum, level)`). `mud/commands/imm_search.py:do_clone` object branch uses `spawn_object` and skips the read-only `name` property in its attribute-copy loop (a fourth layered bug that surfaced once the ImportError was lifted — folded into the same commit). Three success-path regression tests in `tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py` pin each entry point. **Unblocks BCAST-002 / 014 / 015** (broadcasts still need wiring; rows reverted from ⚠️ BLOCKED to ❌).

## [2.9.60]

### Changed
- **`BCAST-007` / `BCAST-020` / `BCAST-029` — three more BCAST rows reclassified to ✅ COVERED** (no code change). Probe (2.9.60) confirmed: `do_envenom` already emits both ROM TO_ROOM acts via the `mud/skills/handlers.py:envenom` handler (lines 3742, 3847); `do_report` emits the room broadcast via an inline `room.people` loop (`mud/commands/info.py:583-595`); `do_violate` routes through `_act_room` for both rooms. The audit's static scan inspected the dispatchers/wrappers, not the handler modules. Same helper-transitivity pattern as the BCAST-001/004/005/008/026 collapses. **Separate fidelity bug surfaced** during the BCAST-029 collapse: `_act_room` and `broadcast_room` lack ROM's `get_trust(rch) >= ch->invis_level` per-recipient filter — filed as **INV-027 candidate ACT-INVIS-TRUST-GATE** in the cross-file invariants Watch list.
- **`BCAST-002` / `BCAST-014` / `BCAST-015` — three rows annotated ⚠️ BLOCKED by WIZLOAD-001** (no code change). Three layered pre-existing bugs in the wiz-load/clone surface: (1) `do_mload` reads non-existent `registry.mob_prototypes` (canonical: `mob_registry`); (2) `do_oload` reads non-existent `registry.obj_prototypes` AND imports non-existent `spawn_obj` from `mud.spawning.obj_spawner` (canonical: `spawn_object`); (3) `do_clone` object-branch has the same `spawn_obj` ImportError. All three commands are wholly broken on real prototypes. Filed as **WIZLOAD-001** in `docs/parity/audits/BROADCAST_COVERAGE.md` "Blocked rows" section with fix shape and effort estimate; the three BCAST rows can't be closed until WIZLOAD-001 lands.

### Fixed
- **`BCAST-018` — `do_quit` now emits the ROM TO_ROOM broadcast** (ROM `src/act_comm.c:1462-1518`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/session.py:do_quit` returned "May your travels be safe." and set `_quit_requested` without informing the room — bystanders saw the player vanish silently. Added `broadcast_room(room, f"{actor_name} has left the game.", exclude=ch)` (act_comm.c:1482) after `save_character` and before the disconnect flag, mirroring ROM's ordering (broadcast fires while the actor is still in `room.people`). The existing fight / below-STUNNED position guards short-circuit before the broadcast, matching ROM. New regression: `tests/integration/test_quit_broadcasts.py` (3/3, including 2 negative-pin tests for the blocked-quit paths).

## [2.9.59]

### Fixed
- **`BCAST-027` — `do_unlock` now emits the three ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts** (ROM `src/act_move.c:706-835`). Symmetric to BCAST-013: pre-fix `do_unlock` returned only "*Click*" with zero `broadcast_room` calls. Added portal-branch TO_ROOM `$n unlocks $p.` (act_move.c:757), container-branch TO_ROOM `$n unlocks $p.` (act_move.c:790), and door-branch TO_ROOM `$n unlocks the $d.` (act_move.c:825). ROM does NOT broadcast to the linked room on unlock (line 832 silently `REMOVE_BIT`s `pexit_rev->exit_info`) — pinned by negative assertion. New regression: `tests/integration/test_unlock_broadcasts.py` (3/3).
- **`BCAST-013` — `do_lock` now emits the three ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts** (ROM `src/act_move.c:571-702`). Pre-fix `do_lock` returned only "*Click*" with zero `broadcast_room` calls. Added portal-branch TO_ROOM `$n locks $p.` (act_move.c:622), container-branch TO_ROOM `$n locks $p.` (act_move.c:655), and door-branch TO_ROOM `$n locks the $d.` (act_move.c:690). ROM does NOT broadcast to the linked room on lock (line 697 silently `SET_BIT`s `pexit_rev->exit_info`) — pinned by a negative assertion in the regression so future "fixes" don't accidentally diverge. New regression: `tests/integration/test_lock_broadcasts.py` (3/3).
- **`BCAST-003` — `do_close` now emits all three ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts plus the linked-room notification** (ROM `src/act_move.c:457-552`). Symmetric to BCAST-016: pre-fix `do_close` returned only the TO_CHAR "Ok." / "You close $p." string with zero `broadcast_room` calls. Added portal-branch TO_ROOM `$n closes $p.` (act_move.c:492), container-branch TO_ROOM `$n closes $p.` (act_move.c:515), door-branch TO_ROOM `$n closes the $d.` (act_move.c:534), and per-person `The $d closes.` in the linked room (act_move.c:545-547). Reuses the `_door_keyword(pexit)` helper added for BCAST-016. New regression: `tests/integration/test_close_broadcasts.py` (4/4).
- **`BCAST-016` — `do_open` now emits all three ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts plus the linked-room notification** (ROM `src/act_move.c:345-453`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/doors.py:do_open` returned only the actor's TO_CHAR string ("Ok." / "You open $p.") with zero `broadcast_room` calls — the room never saw the open and the linked room never learned the door opened from the other side. Added: portal-branch TO_ROOM `$n opens $p.` (act_move.c:384), container-branch TO_ROOM `$n opens $p.` (act_move.c:412), door-branch TO_ROOM `$n opens the $d.` in actor's room (act_move.c:436), and per-person `The $d opens.` in the linked room (act_move.c:447-448). New helper `_door_keyword(pexit)` extracts the first word of `pexit.keyword` to mirror ROM's `$d` substitution. New regression: `tests/integration/test_door_broadcasts.py` (4/4).

### Changed
- **`BCAST-004` / `BCAST-005` / `BCAST-026` — combat-skill rows reclassified to ✅ COVERED** (no code change). Probe of `mud/skills/handlers.py` confirmed `do_dirt` (lines 3018-3026), `do_disarm` (lines 3108-3134), and `do_trip` (lines 7691-7701) already emit all required ROM non-TO_CHAR acts via `broadcast_room` / `_send_to_char` / manual `room.people` loops. The audit's static scan inspected `combat.py:do_*` (dispatcher entry points) but the broadcasts live in the skill handler module. Helper-transitivity caveat — symmetric to the BCAST-001/008 false positive collapsed in 2.9.58.

## [2.9.58]

### Fixed
- **`BCAST-025` — `do_surrender` now emits TO_VICT and TO_NOTVICT broadcasts** (ROM `src/fight.c:3230-3232`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/combat.py:do_surrender` only returned the TO_CHAR text; the opponent and bystanders saw nothing. Added `send_to_char_buffered` delivery of "$n surrenders to you!\n\r" to the opponent and "$n tries to surrender to $N!\n\r" to every other room.people member before `stop_fighting`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_surrender_broadcasts.py`.
- **`BCAST-012` — `do_invis` now emits all three ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:4329-4372`). Three issues compounded: (a) toggle-off wording was "fades **back** into existence" — ROM is canonical and uses "fades into existence" (no "back"); (b) the toggle-on and level-set branches set `invis_level` BEFORE calling `_act_room`, but `_act_room` enforces `can_see_character` — once `invis_level` was committed, witnesses below trust never saw the fade-out, so the audit's R=3 vs Py=0 count was empirically correct (the broadcasts were silently dropped); (c) the level-set-with-arg branch had no `_act_room` call at all. Fixed all three: re-ordered broadcast-before-commit on fade-out, added the level-set broadcast, fixed the wording. New regression: `tests/integration/test_invis_broadcasts.py` (3/3).
- **`BCAST-011` — `do_incognito` now emits all three ROM TO_ROOM broadcasts** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:4375-4418`). Pre-fix the toggle-off (uncloak) and level-set branches had no `_act_room` call. Toggle-on was already correct (incognito does not block in-room `can_see_character` so a post-`incog_level` broadcast still reaches witnesses, unlike the do_invis fade-out case). Added the two missing broadcasts. New regression: `tests/integration/test_incognito_broadcasts.py` (3/3).

### Changed
- **`BCAST-001` / `BCAST-008` — `@goto` / `do_goto` audit rows reclassified to ✅ COVERED** (no code change). The audit's body-only static scan flagged R=4 ROM acts vs Py=0 broadcast hits, but `do_goto` at `mud/commands/imm_commands.py:164` already broadcasts via the `_act_room(old_room, ...)` (bamfout) and `_act_room(location, ...)` (bamfin) helpers at lines 196, 198, 208, 210. The audit missed `_act_room` because it doesn't match the searched literal helpers — helper-transitivity caveat. ROM's 4 acts collapse to 2 effective broadcasts per direction (default + pcdata-bamf variants, only one delivered per direction); Python emits exactly one per direction, equivalent contract.

### Notes
- Class 1 BROADCAST_COVERAGE burn-down is now active. 4 of 29 ❌ rows resolved this session (3 fixed, 1 pair collapsed as false positive). Next ranked candidates: BCAST-004/005/026 (`do_dirt`/`do_disarm`/`do_trip`) — need a helper-transitivity probe vs `damage()` / `one_hit()` before promoting to gap-closers, per the audit's "Combat-skill commands" note.

## [2.9.57]

### Fixed
- **`PARALLEL-002` — `do_nosummon` NPC branch toggled the wrong immunity bit** (`mud/commands/player_config.py:76`). Pre-fix `IMM_SUMMON = 0x00000010` (bit 4) did not match canonical `DefenseBit.SUMMON = 1<<0 = 0x1` (ROM `src/merc.h` letter A). The NPC `nosummon` toggle modified an unrelated immunity bit, leaving the NPC actually-summonable despite the toggle reporting success. Replaced with `int(DefenseBit.SUMMON)`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_imm_summon_bit_alignment.py` (3/3).
- **`PARALLEL-003a` — `do_gain` trainer-lookup checked the wrong `ACT_GAIN` bit** (`mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:211`). Inline `ACT_GAIN = 0x00100000` (bit 20) did not match canonical `ActFlag.GAIN = 1<<27 = 0x8000000` (ROM letter `bb`). Trainer-mob scan failed to recognize canonically-flagged trainers ("You can't do that here.") and spuriously treated mobs with unrelated bit 20 set as trainers. Replaced with `int(ActFlag.GAIN)`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_do_gain_act_gain_bit.py` (3/3).
- **`PARALLEL-003b` — `do_quiet` toggled the wrong `COMM_QUIET` bit** (`mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:105`). Module-local `COMM_QUIET = 0x00000004` (bit 2) did not match canonical `CommFlag.QUIET = 1<<0 = 0x1` (ROM letter A). A player loaded with the canonical QUIET set saw "From now on, you will only hear says and emotes." instead of "Quiet mode removed.", and the toggle disagreed with every other read of `CommFlag.QUIET` in the codebase. Replaced with `int(CommFlag.QUIET)`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_do_quiet_comm_bit.py` (3/3).
- **`PARALLEL-006` — `do_purge` checked the wrong `ACT_NOPURGE` / `ITEM_NOPURGE` bits** (`mud/commands/imm_load.py:184, 194`). Inline `ACT_NOPURGE = 0x00002000` was bit 13 (canonical `ActFlag.NOPURGE = 1<<21 = 0x200000`); `ITEM_NOPURGE = 0x00000040` was bit 6 (canonical `ExtraFlag.NOPURGE = 1<<14 = 0x4000`). Canonically-NOPURGE NPCs/objects were purged anyway; unrelated bits spuriously protected mobs/items. Replaced with `int(ActFlag.NOPURGE)` / `int(ExtraFlag.NOPURGE)`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_do_purge_nopurge_bits.py` (4/4).

### Removed
- **`PARALLEL-008` — dead `.carrying` fallback in `_find_obj_inventory`** (`mud/commands/consumption.py:308-316`). The defensive `getattr(ch, "carrying", [])` branch was unreachable on real `Character` instances (the attribute does not exist) and read as if `.carrying` were still a supported parallel rep. Removed; canonical `char.inventory` is the only path. Existing consumables integration suite (47 tests) covers the live path.

### Changed
- **`PARALLEL-011` — `mud/handler.py:694` `count_users` docstring** updated from "Uses obj.in_room.characters instead of linked list" to "Uses room.people (canonical attribute) instead of linked list" — the original claim was stale; the function walks `in_room.people` per AGENTS.md canonical-attribute rule. Doc-only.

### Notes
- Five active hex-flag bugs surfaced and closed across the PARALLEL_REPRESENTATIONS Class 7 burn-down — the audit's original "LOW (drift-risk)" classification is now confirmed unreliable for any inline hex literal. PARALLEL-002, PARALLEL-003a, PARALLEL-003b, PARALLEL-006 all matched bits that disagreed with canonical IntEnums. Audit doc reclassified accordingly.
- Three of the five gaps (PARALLEL-002, PARALLEL-006, PARALLEL-008+011) were closed by parallel Haiku-model subagent dispatch — agents wrote to the main worktree rather than producing isolated worktree branches (the `isolation: worktree` parameter did not produce separate branches), so the result landed as a single bundled commit (`8d81ed84`). PARALLEL-003a/003b done sequentially on master because they share `remaining_rom.py`.

## [2.9.56]

### Fixed
- **`PARALLEL-005` — `_can_drop_obj` checked the wrong bit** (`mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py:614-621`). Pre-fix the function declared an inline `ITEM_NODROP = 0x0010` which is **`ExtraFlag.EVIL` (bit 4)**, not `ExtraFlag.NODROP` (ROM `merc.h:1111` `H = 1<<7 = 0x80`). `_can_drop_obj` is the gate for `do_drop`, `do_put`, `do_give`, and `inventory.py:do_drop_all`, so pre-fix: cursed/NODROP gear could be dropped freely (the canonical use case for the flag — preventing players from disarming the cursed-weapon penalty), and items flagged `ExtraFlag.EVIL` (a different bit, used to mark items only good-aligned characters should wield) were spuriously blocked from being dropped by a NODROP-shaped rejection. Replaced with `int(ExtraFlag.NODROP)`. Existing test `tests/integration/test_drop_command.py::test_drop_nodrop_item_is_rejected` also encoded the wrong hex (`extra_flags = 0x0010`) — per AGENTS.md "ROM is source of truth, a test asserting behavior contradicting ROM C is a bug in the test", the test now uses `int(ExtraFlag.NODROP)`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_can_drop_obj_nodrop_bit.py` (3/3 — NODROP rejected, EVIL allowed, unflagged allowed).

## [2.9.55]

### Fixed
- **`PARALLEL-001` + `PARALLEL-004` — `do_config` display now reflects actual flag state** (`mud/commands/misc_player.py`). Pre-fix the `configs` table hardcoded hex literals (`autoloot = 0x00008000`, `autosac = 0x00010000`, `compact = 0x00000200`, `afk = COMM_AFK = 0x00000800`, …) that did **not** match the canonical IntEnum bit values the toggle commands actually set. ROM letter macros are bit-shifts (`A=1<<0`, `C=1<<2`, `E=1<<4`, `L=1<<11`, `M=1<<12`, `Z=1<<25`, …); `mud/models/constants.py` mirrors them, but the hex literals in this file came from a different (wrong) convention. Symptom: `autoloot` toggle flipped `PlayerFlag.AUTOLOOT` (bit 4) but the table read bit 15 — `config` always showed OFF for `autoloot`/`autosac`/`autoexit`. Worse, brief toggle (`CommFlag.BRIEF` = 1<<12) collided with the table's "combine" hex (`0x00001000` = bit 12), so `brief` ON lit up "combine ON" in the display. Fix: replaced every hex literal with `int(PlayerFlag.X)` / `int(CommFlag.X)`, and re-pointed module-local `COMM_AFK` alias at `int(CommFlag.AFK)`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_do_config_flag_alignment.py` (2/2). Audit hypothesis "drift-risk only" overturned — re-classified PARALLEL-001 and PARALLEL-004 as MEDIUM active bugs in `docs/parity/audits/PARALLEL_REPRESENTATIONS.md`.

## [2.9.54]

### Fixed
- **`PARALLEL-010` — `do_flee` now actually moves the character** (ROM `src/fight.c:2970-3028` `do_flee`). Pre-fix `mud/commands/combat.py:683-688` wrote to `room.characters` / `new_room.characters` — neither attribute exists; `Room` defines `people`. The `hasattr(room, "characters")` gate silently hid the source-room remove (always False → no remove); `new_room.characters.append(char)` raised `AttributeError` caught by a broad `try/except` at lines 695-696 that surfaced a misleading "Flee failed: 'Room' object has no attribute 'characters'" while `char.move` was still decremented at line 699. Net pre-fix effect: character paid the move cost but did not actually move — `char.room` was reassigned but `room.people` was never updated, leaving the character invisible to anyone looking at the destination room and incorrectly present in the source room's `people` list. Replaced with canonical `room.remove_character(char)` / `new_room.add_character(char)` (defined at `mud/models/room.py:140, 157`) — these update `room.people` correctly and run the ROM `handler.c:1504-1573` light-source / nplayer / furniture bookkeeping. Also fixed the same parallel-rep bug at line 665 (room-broadcast loop iterated `room.characters` → silently empty broadcast; now iterates `room.people`). Surfaced by parallel META audit Class 7 (`docs/parity/audits/PARALLEL_REPRESENTATIONS.md`). New regression: `tests/integration/test_flee_moves_character.py` (`test_flee_moves_character_to_new_room`).

## [2.9.53]

### Fixed
- **`MATH-001` — `calculate_weapon_damage` damroll line now uses `c_div`** (ROM `src/fight.c` `one_hit`: `dam += GET_DAMROLL(ch) * UMIN(100, skill) / 100`). Python's `//` floors toward negative infinity; C's `/` truncates toward zero. With cursed gear or debuffs `get_damroll` can be negative, so the product is negative and any product not evenly divisible by 100 falls on the diverging side: e.g. `damroll=-1, skill=99` → product `-99` → Python `// 100` gives `-1`, ROM `c_div(-99, 100)` gives `0`. Net effect: Python over-debited damage by 1 in the cursed-damroll regime. Replaced `// 100` with `c_div(..., 100)` at `mud/combat/engine.py:1290`. Surfaced by the parallel META audit Class 8 (`docs/parity/audits/MATH_AND_RNG.md`). New regression: `tests/integration/test_weapon_damage_damroll_c_div.py` (`test_damroll_uses_c_truncation_not_python_floor`).

## [2.9.52]

### Added
- **Three META audit docs landed in parallel** — Classes 1, 7, 8 from `docs/parity/META_AUDIT_TAXONOMY.md`. Audits-only commit; no runtime behavior changes. Burn-down candidates extracted (see SESSION_SUMMARY).
  - `docs/parity/audits/BROADCAST_COVERAGE.md` (Class 1, 347 lines, 283 of ~284 dispatcher commands) — 209 ✅ / 10 ⚠️ / 29 ❌ / 35 N/A. Caveat: shallow body-only scan; ❌ count is inflated by helper-transitivity (door commands almost certainly covered by `world/movement.py`; combat skills routed through `damage()`). Top 3 gap candidates: `do_disarm`/`do_trip`/`do_dirt`/`do_surrender` TO_VICT+TO_NOTVICT (if not delegated), `do_goto` poofin/poofout broadcasts, `do_invis`/`do_incognito` visibility-transition broadcasts. Stable IDs `BCAST-001` … `BCAST-039`.
  - `docs/parity/audits/PARALLEL_REPRESENTATIONS.md` (Class 7, 15 rows) — 1 ❌ / 8 ⚠️ / 6 ✅. Hypothesis "mostly closed by INV-012/INV-013/INV-014" upheld. Single ❌ `PARALLEL-010`: `mud/commands/combat.py:683-688` `do_flee` writes to nonexistent `room.characters` / `new_room.characters` — `hasattr` gate hides the remove silently, `append` raises `AttributeError` caught by broad `try/except` that surfaces a misleading "Flee failed" while `char.move` is still decremented at line 699 (char pays move cost but doesn't move). Eight ⚠️ are inline hex flag aliases duplicating existing IntEnums + a dead `.carrying` fallback in `consumption.py:308-316`.
  - `docs/parity/audits/MATH_AND_RNG.md` (Class 8) — 1 ❌ HIGH / 3 ⚠️ LOW / ~110 ✅. RNG channel **completely clean** (0 `import random` / `random.*` hits in `mud/`). Single ❌ `MATH-001`: `mud/combat/engine.py:1290` uses `//` on `get_damroll(attacker) * min(100, skill_total)` where `get_damroll` can be negative (cursed gear/debuffs) — Python floor-div diverges from ROM C truncate-toward-zero. Three ⚠️ are currently-safe-via-upstream-clamps but fragile under refactor. Includes PARITY008 + PARITY009 ruff rule sketches with allowlist mechanism.

## [2.9.51]

### Fixed
- **`RESTORE-001` — `do_restore` now strips plague/poison/blindness/sleep/curse** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2807, 2839, 2861` — five `affect_strip` calls at every restore code path). Python's `_restore_char` in `mud/commands/imm_load.py` was only refilling hit/mana/move and clamping position — the affect strip was a TODO comment ("In full implementation, would strip..."). A poisoned/plagued/blinded/sleeping/cursed character that got restored stayed afflicted, contrary to ROM. Added a loop calling `char.strip_affect(name)` for each of the five named affects before vitals are refilled. New regression: `tests/integration/test_restore_strips_affects.py` (`test_restore_strips_poison_plague_blindness_sleep_curse`).

## [2.9.50]

### Added
- **`SLAY-002` — `do_slay` now emits TO_VICT + TO_NOTVICT broadcasts** (ROM `src/fight.c:3282-3284`). Pre-fix Python only returned the TO_CHAR string ("You slay X in cold blood!"); the victim and bystanders got nothing. Added two broadcasts before `raw_kill(victim)`: TO_VICT "$n slays you in cold blood!\n\r" to the victim, TO_NOTVICT "$n slays $N in cold blood!\n\r" to every other room occupant (excluding both attacker and victim). Broadcasts must fire pre-kill because `raw_kill` removes the victim from the room. New regression: `tests/integration/test_slay_broadcasts.py` (`test_slay_sends_to_vict_and_notvict`).

## [2.9.49]

### Fixed
- **`PURGE-001` — `do_purge` now routes through the canonical `_extract_character` chokepoint** (ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2595, 2638, 2646` — three `extract_char(victim, TRUE)` call sites). Python's immortal `purge` command was calling the same stripped-down local `_extract_char` stub that `do_slay` (closed in 2.9.48) was using: stops fighting, unlinks from `room.people`, removes from `registry.char_list` — but bypasses the INV-020 cleanup chain (`nuke_pets` + `die_follower`) and skips inventory extraction. Symptom: an immortal purging a charmed pet's master left the pet in the world with a dangling `master` pointer and `AFF_CHARM` still set; group followers kept their `leader` pointing at the extracted Character (the same dangling-pointer hazard INV-020 was created to close). Wired all three call sites (room-purge loop, named-player purge, named-NPC purge) through `mud/mob_cmds.py:_extract_character` so the full ROM `src/handler.c:2103-2180 extract_char` pipeline runs. Removed the now-unused local `_extract_char` stub. New regression: `tests/integration/test_purge_routes_through_extract_character.py` (`test_purge_room_nukes_pets` — pins the pet-cleanup leg; the follower leg is already locked by INV-020's chain test grid via the shared helper).

## [2.9.48]

### Fixed
- **`SLAY-001` — `do_slay` now routes through `raw_kill`** (ROM `src/fight.c:3285`). Python's immortal `slay` command was calling a stripped-down local `_extract_char` stub (stops fighting + unlinks from room.people + removes from `registry.char_list`) that bypassed the entire death pipeline: no corpse, no `death_cry`, no gold/silver drop, no INV-020 cleanup chain (charmed pets and group followers leaked with dangling `master`/`leader` pointers). Surfaced during the TRIG_KILL/TRIG_DEATH dispatch probe — slay turned out not to be a trigger-dispatch bug (ROM `do_slay` deliberately skips TRIG_DEATH; it calls `raw_kill` directly), but the routing-through-stub itself was a real divergence. Replaced the `_extract_char(victim)` call with `raw_kill(victim)`; the slain NPC now produces a corpse, drops gold, and runs the cleanup chain. The missing TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT room broadcasts (ROM lines 3282-3284) are filed as a separate follow-up gap. The same stripped `_extract_char` stub is also used by `do_purge` (3 call sites in `mud/commands/imm_load.py`) — that's an adjacent INV-020-touching gap to close next. New regression: `tests/integration/test_slay_routes_through_raw_kill.py` (`test_slay_produces_corpse_for_npc` — pins the corpse-spawn contract; the pet/follower legs come along for free via the shared `raw_kill` helper).

## [2.9.47]

### Fixed
- **INV-020 disconnect-cleanup leg closed — `_disconnect_extract_cleanup` helper extracted from `mud/net/connection.py` `finally` blocks.** ROM `src/handler.c:2117-2122 extract_char` requires every PC-extract trigger to call `nuke_pets` + `die_follower`; the socket-close path (treated as `do_quit` semantics per INV-009) was the last leg still bypassing both cleanups. Extracted a module-level `_disconnect_extract_cleanup(char)` helper (calls `_nuke_pets + char.pet = None + die_follower`) and wired it into both telnet and websocket disconnect `finally` blocks, gated on `not forced_disconnect` because `_disconnect_session` transfers the live Character to a new descriptor (the Character is not being extracted there). With this fix, all four PC-extract triggers — `raw_kill`, void-quit auto-pull (`_auto_quit_character`), `do_pull`-derived `_extract_character`, and socket disconnect — funnel through the same cleanup chain. New regression: `tests/integration/test_inv020_extract_quit_cleanup.py` extended with `test_disconnect_nukes_pets` + `test_disconnect_calls_die_follower` (calls the helper directly so the cleanup chain is verifiable without standing up a real socket).

## [2.9.46]

### Fixed
- **INV-020 expanded — `_auto_quit_character` (void-quit auto-pull) now calls `_nuke_pets` + `die_follower`** (ROM `src/handler.c:2117-2122 extract_char`). The original INV-020 row locked only the raw_kill leg; the void-quit path bypassed both cleanups, leaving charmed pets in the world with a dangling `master` pointer (and `AFF_CHARM` still set) and every other character's `master`/`leader` pointer at the quit-er dangling at the extracted Character. `is_same_group` would then false-positive matches via the stale leader pointer — the same dangling-pointer hazard INV-020 closed at raw_kill. Renamed the row to `INV-020 EXTRACT-CHAR-CLEANUP-CHAIN` and added the void-quit leg to the contract. The `mud/commands/session.py:do_quit` → `mud/net/connection.py` disconnect-cleanup leg is **still open** — that fix requires a small refactor to extract a `_disconnect_cleanup(char)` helper from the anonymous `finally` blocks (telnet line 1989+, websocket line 2263+); filed as the next follow-up gap-closer. New regression: `tests/integration/test_inv020_extract_quit_cleanup.py` (2 tests — `test_void_quit_nukes_pets` for the pet-cleanup leg, `test_void_quit_calls_die_follower` for the follower-cleanup leg; each pins one sub-contract so a future regression on either is visible).

## [2.9.45]

### Fixed
- **`affect_check` now walks equipped objects' prototype affects** (ROM `src/handler.c:1240-1257`). Previously Python only walked per-instance `obj.affected` on equipment, missing the prototype fallback that ROM uses. Symptom: a player wearing a `+sanc` ring whose AFF_SANCTUARY grant lives on the prototype (`A` entries in `.are` files — the normal ROM pattern) and a temporary `sanctuary` spell would lose the AFF_SANCTUARY bit when the spell expired. `affect_modify(ch, paf, FALSE)` cleared the bit; `affect_check` then failed to find the prototype-level grant and didn't re-set it, leaving the wearer without sanctuary even though the ring was still on. `equip_char` / `unequip_char` (`mud/handler.py:179, 240`) were already walking the prototype correctly — only `affect_check` had the asymmetry. The new prototype walk is gated on `obj.enchanted == False` (ROM `src/handler.c:1237-1238`); enchanted instances are authoritative via their per-instance `affected` list. Affects on prototypes may be stored as `Affect` dataclasses or plain `dict` entries depending on the loader path, so the walk handles both. New regression: `tests/integration/test_affect_check_prototype_fallback.py` (2 tests — unenchanted prototype walk; enchanted skip). Single-function fix, no new INV-NNN row (the contract is intra-module).

## [2.9.44]

### Fixed
- **`check_assist` misplacement closed — assist-on-multi_hit lifted to `violence_tick`.** ROM `src/fight.c:90` calls `check_assist(ch, victim)` from `violence_update` after `multi_hit` returns, not from inside `multi_hit`. Python had it embedded in `mud/combat/engine.py:multi_hit` at line 317, so every direct caller of `multi_hit` provoked an additional assist round: `mud/combat/assist.py` (the recursive assist itself), `mud/spec_funs.py` (spec_cast paths), and `mud/mob_cmds.py` (mob `kill` directive). Lifted the call to `mud/game_loop.py:violence_tick` before the NPC trigger dispatch, mirroring ROM's `check_assist` → IS_NPC → TRIG_FIGHT/TRIG_HPCNT ordering. The violence_tick now re-reads `attacker.fighting is victim` twice — once after `multi_hit` (victim-died guard), once after `check_assist` (helper-landed-killing-blow guard). Same misplacement shape as INV-026; folded under INV-026 in the tracker since both contracts derive from `src/fight.c:60-99 violence_update`. New regression: `tests/integration/test_check_assist_dispatch_scope.py` (3 tests — multi_hit-direct silence, violence_tick dispatch, victim-died guard). `tests/test_combat_assist.py::test_assist_triggered_during_combat` rewritten to drive `violence_tick` instead of `multi_hit` directly (the old assertion contradicted ROM; per AGENTS.md a test asserting non-ROM behavior is a bug in the test).

## [2.9.43]

### Fixed
- **INV-026 enforced — TRIG_FIGHT / TRIG_HPCNT now fire only from `violence_tick`, never from `multi_hit`.** ROM `src/fight.c:60-99 violence_update` is the only site that fires these two triggers, after `multi_hit` returns and only when the victim is still fighting (`(victim = ch->fighting) == NULL` guard). Pre-2.9.43 Python dispatched both triggers at the end of `mud/combat/engine.py:multi_hit` (the shallow HPCNT-001 enforcement point), so every caller of `multi_hit` — assist mobs joining combat (`mud/combat/assist.py`), special-function attacks (`mud/spec_funs.py`), and `mob kill` directives (`mud/mob_cmds.py`) — wrongly fired TRIG_FIGHT and TRIG_HPCNT on the attacker. The dispatch is now lifted to `mud/game_loop.py:violence_tick` after the `multi_hit` call, guarded by `attacker.fighting is victim` (re-read post-multi_hit, mirroring ROM's `(victim = ch->fighting) == NULL`). HPCNT-001's previous test (`test_hpcnt_fires_exactly_once_per_multi_hit`) is renamed to `test_hpcnt_fires_exactly_once_per_violence_tick` and asserts at the deeper layer; `tests/test_mobprog_triggers.py::test_event_hooks_fire_rom_triggers` now drives `violence_tick(do_combat=True)` directly. New regression: `tests/integration/test_inv026_violence_trigger_dispatch.py` (3 tests — multi_hit-direct silence, violence_tick dispatch, victim-died guard). Tracker row: INV-026 VIOLENCE-TRIGGER-DISPATCH-SCOPE in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`. Adjacent misplacement of `check_assist` inside `multi_hit` (ROM has it in `violence_update`) is documented in the tracker but intentionally deferred to a separate gap-closer.
- **Dead `char.location` fallbacks stripped.** Following the 2.9.42 INV-025 sweep that surfaced a real bug in `do_put` reading the non-existent `Character.location` (an `Affect` attribute, not `Character`), this strips the misleading `or getattr(char, "location", ...)` fallbacks from five callsites where they were dead code: `_perform_remove` and `do_quaff` (`mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py`), `do_eat`/EAT-004 broadcast (`mud/commands/consumption.py`), and three audit-tally `setattr` sites (`mud/spawning/reset_handler.py`). No behavior change — `char.room` always wins in normal operation; the inner `getattr` never resolved. Removing the dead alternative prevents the typo cluster from spreading further. Per AGENTS.md "no backwards-compatibility hacks like unused fallbacks".

## [2.9.42]

### Fixed
- **INV-025 follow-up sweep — ROM act() callsites now dispatch TRIG_ACT.** With INV-025 (`MOBPROG-ACT-TRIGGER-DISPATCH`) enforced at the emote site in 2.9.40, this release wires `mp_act_trigger_room` into the remaining ROM act() producers so TRIG_ACT mobprogs respond to the full vocabulary of room events:
  - `do_give` (`mud/commands/give.py`) wraps its broadcast in `disable_mobtrigger()` to mirror ROM's `MOBtrigger = FALSE` recursion guard (`src/act_obj.c:832-836`); the explicit `mp_give_trigger` still covers the give event.
  - `do_drop` (`mud/commands/inventory.py`) dispatches at all three drop sites (coins, single-obj, drop-all) plus the `MELT_DROP` "dissolves into smoke" follow-up (`src/act_obj.c:586, 608, 632`).
  - `do_get` (`mud/commands/inventory.py`) dispatches on get-from-container and get-from-floor (`src/act_obj.c:151, 158`).
  - `do_put` (`mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py`) dispatches at all four broadcast sites (single/all × on/in) (`src/act_obj.c:440-446, 479-485`). Also fixed a latent bug — `do_put` read `char.location` (an `Affect` attribute, not a `Character` attribute) instead of `char.room`, so the broadcast never reached room observers; switched to `char.room` consistent with ROM's `ch->in_room`.
  - `do_sacrifice` (`mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py`) dispatches on the "$n sacrifices $p to Mota." broadcast (`src/act_obj.c:1856`).
  - Equipment commands — `do_wear`, `do_wield`, `do_hold`/light, `_wear_all` in `mud/commands/equipment.py`, plus the shared `_unequip_to_inventory` "stops using" path and the canonical `_perform_remove` in `mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py` (`src/act_obj.c:1419, 1435-1612, 1639, 1674`; `src/handler.c:remove_obj`).
  - Position-transition broadcasts — `_broadcast_pos_change` in `mud/combat/engine.py`, the central helper used by `apply_position_change`, `holy_word`, `decay_corpse`, and every spell that calls `update_pos` directly (`src/fight.c:837-861`).
  - Regression tests: `tests/integration/test_inv025_do_give_act_trigger_suppression.py`, `test_inv025_do_drop_act_trigger_dispatch.py`, `test_inv025_do_get_act_trigger_dispatch.py`, `test_inv025_do_put_act_trigger_dispatch.py`, `test_inv025_do_sacrifice_act_trigger_dispatch.py`, `test_inv025_equipment_act_trigger_dispatch.py`, `test_inv025_position_transition_act_trigger_dispatch.py` (8 tests total). Each test asserts that an NPC with a `TRIG_ACT` mobprog matching the canonical trigger phrase fires `mp_act_trigger` when a PC performs the action.
  - The INV-025 contract itself is unchanged — still locked at `do_emote` by the 2.9.40 enforcement test. The sweep widens coverage; it cannot regress what is already enforced. No new INV row.

## [2.9.41]

### Changed
- **Cross-file invariants tracker consolidated.** Three dual pairs merged in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` to bring the budget from 25/~20 back to 22/~20 (each merge freed one slot without losing a contract — both halves' tests still run under the merged row). INV-014 (OBJECT-REGISTRY-MEMBERSHIP) + INV-021 (OBJECT-EXTRACT-RECURSIVE) → INV-014 OBJECT-REGISTRY-LIFECYCLE (creation + extract on the same `object_registry`). INV-015 (AFFECT-TICK-LIFECYCLE) + INV-018 (WEAR-OFF-MESSAGE-FOR-RAW-AFFECT) → INV-015 AFFECT-EXPIRY-LIFECYCLE (stat-mod un-apply + wear-off message on the same `tick_spell_effects` expiry loop). INV-010 (ROOM-PEOPLE-COHERENCE) + INV-023 (AREA-NPLAYER-COHERENCE) → INV-010 ROOM-PEOPLE-COHERENCE (bidirectional coherence + area.nplayer accounting on `char_from_room`/`char_to_room`). INV-001 + INV-002 were *not* merged — the 2.9.39 footer mis-described them as "message-delivery duals" but INV-001 is SINGLE-DELIVERY (broadcast routing) while INV-002 is PROMPT-CLAMP (display formatting). They share no enforcement point. Retired IDs (INV-018, INV-021, INV-023) kept as forward-pointer stubs in a new "Retired IDs" section so historical CHANGELOG entries and commit messages resolve. Underlying enforcement tests are unchanged.

## [2.9.40]

### Added
- **INV-025 — MOBPROG-ACT-TRIGGER-DISPATCH enforced.** Ports ROM's `bool MOBtrigger` global (`src/comm.c:311`) and the per-recipient `mp_act_trigger` dispatch inside `act()` (`src/comm.c:2384-2385`). New module-level `MOBtrigger: bool = True` flag in `mud/mobprog.py`, paired with a `disable_mobtrigger()` context manager that mirrors ROM's `MOBtrigger = FALSE; act(...); MOBtrigger = TRUE;` recursion-guard pattern (`src/act_obj.c:832-836 do_give`, `src/mob_cmds.c:333-335 do_at`). Nesting is safe — the previous value is restored on exit. New `mp_act_trigger_room(message, room, ch, *, arg1, arg2, exclude)` helper iterates `room.people`, skips PCs / `ch` / `exclude`, and fires `mp_act_trigger` per NPC when `MOBtrigger` is True. First wired callsite is `mud/commands/communication.py:do_emote` — the canonical ROM TRIG_ACT producer (`act("$n $T", ch, NULL, argument, TO_ROOM)` at `src/act_comm.c:1091`). Pre-INV-025, every TRIG_ACT mobprog responding to PC emotes silently no-opped because Python only routed speech to mobprog. Regression test `tests/integration/test_inv025_mobprog_act_trigger_dispatch.py` (3 cases: PC emote fires TRIG_ACT on listening NPC, `disable_mobtrigger()` context suppresses dispatch, NPC emoter does not self-fire). Follow-up wiring sweep (broader act() callsites — do_give, drop, get, put, sacrifice, equipment, position-transition broadcasts) tracked as ad-hoc commits, not a new INV row. Budget: 25 of ~20 enforced — trips the AGENTS.md consolidation threshold; pre-documented merge candidates in tracker footer.

## [2.9.39]

### Added
- **INV-025 candidate filed (NOT YET ENFORCED) — MOBPROG-ACT-TRIGGER-DISPATCH.** Probe surfaced a real systemic gap: ROM `src/comm.c:2384-2385` fires `mp_act_trigger(buf, to, ch, arg1, arg2, TRIG_ACT)` inside `act()` itself for every NPC recipient with `HAS_TRIGGER(TRIG_ACT)` — every TO_ROOM / TO_NOTVICT / TO_CHAR / TO_VICT broadcast feeds into mobprog dispatch. Python's `act_format` + `broadcast_room` does not dispatch at all; only `do_say` / `do_yell` route to `mp_speech_trigger`, so every TRIG_ACT mobprog in the world file silently no-ops. Not closed in 2.9.39: ROM uses the `MOBtrigger` global (`src/comm.c:311`, toggled FALSE in `do_mob` and recursive paths) as the only recursion guard. `mud/mobprog.py` has no equivalent guard (confirmed by grep). Wiring TRIG_ACT into `broadcast_room` without porting MOBtrigger semantics would cause re-entry on any TRIG_ACT response that itself calls `act()`. Scope: audit-then-implement, not probe-then-close — deferred to a dedicated session. Filed in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` Watch list with prerequisite documented.

### Documented
- **PORTAL-TRAVEL-OBJ-DECAY probed clean.** Portal charge depletion (`mud/world/movement.py:580-584`) reads/writes `portal.value[0]` on the instance (not the prototype), and timer decay (`mud/game_loop.py:1157-1188`) honours `timer <= 0` as "no decay armed" and routes extraction through `_extract_obj` (covered by INV-013/INV-021). No gap surfaced; no INV row filed (would dilute the "each INV pins a real divergence" precedent).

## [2.9.38]

### Fixed
- **`do_get` CONT_CLOSED check now reads from the OBJ_DATA instance, not the prototype.** Previously `mud/commands/inventory.py:do_get` (line 513-514) consulted `container.prototype.value[1]` for the closed-container gate; ROM's `src/act_obj.c:291` reads `container->value[1]` off the OBJ_DATA instance, where open/close actually writes. Production container prototypes default to open, so every freshly-spawned container with the closed flag set on its instance had its lid effectively transparent to `get all <container>` and `get <obj> <container>` — players could pull contents out without ever opening the container. `do_put` and `look in <container>` were already reading the instance correctly. Test fixture in `tests/integration/test_container_retrieval.py:create_container` updated to copy `proto.value` onto the instance per the AGENTS.md "Object.__post_init__ does not auto-sync value" rule; the old test passed only because the broken `do_get` happened to mirror the fixture's broken value-sync.

### Added
- **INV-024 — CONTAINER-CLOSED-VISIBILITY pinned.** Four-surface contract: `do_get` (`mud/commands/inventory.py:do_get`), `do_put` (`mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py:do_put`), `look in <container>` (`mud/world/look.py:_look_at_object`), and `do_examine` (`mud/commands/info_extended.py:do_examine`, which delegates to `do_look "in <name>"`) must all refuse to act on a container with `CONT_CLOSED` set on its instance `value[1]`. Regression test `tests/integration/test_inv024_container_closed_visibility.py` (4 cases: get-all blocked, put blocked, look-in hides contents, open-control allows transfer) catches any future surface that reads from prototype or skips the gate. ROM `src/act_obj.c:291-295`, `:384-388`; `src/act_info.c:1160-1162`, `:1320-1386`.

## [2.9.37]

### Fixed
- **`do_recall` no longer bypasses `area.nplayer` accounting.** Previously `mud/commands/session.py:do_recall` mutated `room.people` directly via `.remove`/`.append`, skipping `Room.remove_character`/`Room.add_character` and therefore skipping the ROM `char_from_room`/`char_to_room` side-effects: `area.nplayer` decrement on departure, increment on arrival, `area.empty=False`/`area.age=0` reset on first PC arrival, and lit-light-source room counter updates. Cross-area recall left the source area permanently overcounted (gating its resets/empty/age logic incorrectly per `src/db.c:1617-1808`) and the temple area undercounted. Fixed to route through the canonical helpers; matches ROM `src/handler.c:1491-1568`.

### Added
- **INV-023 — AREA-NPLAYER-COHERENCE pinned.** Three-module contract: every PC room transition must funnel through `Room.add_character`/`Room.remove_character`, which own `area.nplayer` + `area.empty` + `area.age` + room.light side-effects; the helpers must gate the counter on `not is_npc`; and area-reset code (`mud/spawning/reset_handler.py`) must consult `area.nplayer` rather than counting `room.people` directly. Regression test `tests/integration/test_inv023_area_nplayer_coherence.py` (2 cases: cross-area recall decrement/increment, and first-PC-arrival empty/age reset) surfaces any future PC-movement site that open-codes `room.people.append`/`remove`. NPC-only direct manipulators in `mud/mob_cmds.py`, `mud/spec_funs.py`, and `mud/spawning/templates.py:MobInstance.move_to_room` are intentional — the ROM counter excludes NPCs. INV tracker: 22 → 23 of ~20 budget.

## [2.9.36]

### Added
- **INV-022 — EQUIP-APPLIES-OBJECT-AFFECTS pinned with regression test.** Three-module contract: `mud/commands/equipment.py` (do_wear/do_remove/do_wield/do_hold) must route through `mud/handler.py:equip_char`/`unequip_char`, which walk `obj.affected` and call `affect_modify(ch, paf, True/False)` per ROM `src/handler.c:1754-1797`/`1804-1877`. The lower-level `Character.equip_object`/`Character.remove_object` only move the obj between inventory and equipment dict — they do NOT propagate affects. Two `Character.equip_object` direct call sites exist in `mud/commands/inventory.py:159,172` (inside `give_school_outfit`) operating on items whose `obj.affected` is empty by design (vanilla starter gear); a future school-outfit item with affects would need to route through `equip_char`. Currently enforced by construction; test `tests/integration/test_inv022_equip_applies_object_affects.py` (7 cases including HITROLL/DAMROLL apply, strip, round-trip zero-delta, and parametrized positive/negative modifiers) catches any regression in the production wear/wield path. INV tracker: 21 → 22 of ~20 budget, with re-evaluation criteria for consolidation now documented at the bottom of the tracker.

## [2.9.35]

### Added
- **INV-021 — OBJECT-EXTRACT-RECURSIVE pinned with regression test.** Dual of INV-014: where INV-014 enforces "every new Object lands in `object_registry`", INV-021 enforces "every `_extract_obj` call drains the registry, all the way down through `obj.contains`". ROM `src/handler.c:2052-2086 extract_obj` recurses into `obj->contains` before removing the outer object from `object_list`; Python's `mud/game_loop.py:_extract_obj` (lines 982-1005) mirrors this with an unbounded recursive call at line 983-984. Without recursion, nested items in extracted containers would survive in the world-scan registry — visible to `spell_locate_object`, counted by save sweeps. Currently enforced by construction; test `tests/integration/test_inv021_object_extract_recursive.py` (2 cases: depth-1 sack-with-items, depth-N nested-container chain) surfaces any future refactor that skips the recursion. INV tracker now at 21 of ~20 budget — over by one; documented as deliberate per-contract entry, re-evaluate consolidation when next row is proposed.

## [2.9.34]

### Added
- **INV-020 — GROUP-LEADER-COHERENCE-ON-RAW-KILL pinned with regression test.** Contract: `mud/combat/death.py:raw_kill` must call `die_follower(victim)` before `character_registry.remove(victim)`; `mud/characters/follow.py:die_follower` must walk the registry and reset every `fch.leader is char` to `fch.leader = fch` (NOT to None — `is_same_group` would otherwise still equate two former members via the dangling pointer at the corpse, per `src/handler.c:2018`). Currently enforced by construction; this row pins the three-module contract (death funnel + follower-chain cleanup + `is_same_group` consult) with `tests/integration/test_inv020_group_leader_coherence_on_raw_kill.py` so a future refactor that re-orders raw_kill or extracts a victim outside the cleanup path fails loudly. Tracker `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` budget now sits at 20 of ~20 INV-NNN rows ✅ ENFORCED.

## [2.9.33]

### Fixed
- **FOLLOW-001 — `add_follower` master-side message now gated on `can_see(master, follower)`** (ROM `src/act_comm.c:1602-1603`). The `mud/characters/follow.py:add_follower` copy (wired into combat death, shop hires, skill handlers, `mob_cmds`) emitted `"$n now follows you."` unconditionally, leaking an invisible follower's identity to a master without DETECT_INVIS. The `mud/commands/group_commands.py:add_follower` copy used by `do_follow` was already ROM-faithful. Fix imports `can_see_character` from `mud.world.vision` and wraps the TO_VICT branch. The TO_CHAR `"You now follow $N."` stays unconditional per ROM line 1605. Test: `tests/integration/test_follow_can_see_gating.py::test_follow_001_add_follower_gates_master_message_on_can_see`.
- **FOLLOW-002 — `stop_follower` messages now gated on `can_see(master, follower) and follower.room is not None`** (ROM `src/act_comm.c:1625-1629`). Both TO_VICT and TO_CHAR branches were unconditional in `mud/characters/follow.py:stop_follower`; ROM gates both. Detach state (`follower.master = None`, `leader = None`, `master.pet` clear) stays unconditional per ROM lines 1631-1635. Tests: `tests/integration/test_follow_can_see_gating.py::test_follow_002_stop_follower_gates_both_messages_on_can_see_and_in_room` and `::test_follow_002_stop_follower_skips_messages_when_in_room_is_none`.
- **DUPL-018 closed via FOLLOW-001/002 gap-closer.** Audit row in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md` flipped from ⚠️ NEEDS NEW GAP (refile from 2.9.31) to ✅ FIXED. Audit row also added to `docs/parity/ACT_COMM_C_AUDIT.md` under `#### 17b. add_follower() / stop_follower() helpers`. Burn-down of the DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS audit is now genuinely closed — no refiled rows outstanding.

## [2.9.32]

### Changed
- **DUPL audit CLOSED — final reclassify pass for DUPL-009/012/013/014/015/016/017/020/021/022/023/024 as ✅ MATCH (divergent-by-design at fix-time re-audit).** Subagent surveys at the start of this session reported these rows as "functionally identical CLEANUP candidates"; fix-time re-reading each row showed 9 of them are **divergent-by-design**, not mechanical cleanups. Mechanical consolidation would either change behavior (DUPL-009's 3 trust semantics: plain vs is_admin-bump vs is_npc→0) or re-introduce already-fixed bug classes (DUPL-020's 3 message-append semantics, where forcing a single canonical would re-introduce DUPL-001/002-class double-delivery). Each row's actual semantics + rationale documented in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md` CLEANUP section. **DUPL-018 refiled** as a separate ROM-parity gap, not a cleanup: `follow.py:add_follower` omits the ROM `can_see` gating before showing master "X follows you", and `follow.py:stop_follower` omits the `has_spell_effect("charm person") + remove_spell_effect` cleanup logic — both are real divergences from `src/act_comm.c:1602-1628` and need their own gap-closer commit. Methodology lesson: the per-row subagent classification had ~30% precision on CLEANUP rows; fix-time re-audit is mandatory.
- **DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS audit fully closed.** Final tally: 6 ❌ real bugs ✅ FIXED (DUPL-001 family, 002, 003, 004, 005, 007), 1 ⚠️ DEAD-CODE ✅ FIXED (DUPL-006), 1 ✅ MATCH at fix-time (DUPL-008 immortal-bypass), 3 ⚠️ CLEANUP ✅ FIXED (DUPL-010, 011, 019), 9 ⚠️ CLEANUP reclassified to ✅ MATCH, 1 refiled as separate gap (DUPL-018). Every DUPL-NNN ID has terminal status. Burn-down complete.

## [2.9.31]

### Changed
- **DUPL-010 — consolidated 6 duplicate `_is_awake` helpers onto `Character.is_awake()`** (canonical at `mud/models/character.py:452`, returns `self.position > Position.SLEEPING`). Deletions in: `mud/combat/assist.py`, `mud/math/stat_apps.py`, `mud/ai/aggressive.py`, `mud/commands/advancement.py`, `mud/commands/thief_skills.py`. Call sites converted to `char.is_awake()`. `mud/spec_funs.py` retains a thin defensive `_is_awake` wrapper because spec-fun unit tests pass `SimpleNamespace` mocks that can't bind methods — wrapper checks `getattr(ch, "is_awake", None)` and falls back to direct `position` attribute. Also added `MobInstance.is_awake()` method (alongside the existing `MobInstance.has_affect()`) since `_is_awake(mob)` call sites previously relied on defensive `getattr` and now resolve to the bound method.
- **DUPL-011 — consolidated 5 duplicate `_has_affect` helpers onto `Character.has_affect(flag)`** (canonical at `mud/models/character.py:625`, returns `bool(self.affected_by & flag)`). Deletions in: `mud/game_loop.py`, `mud/spec_funs.py`, `mud/world/vision.py`, `mud/ai/aggressive.py`, `mud/commands/shop.py`. 44 call sites converted to `entity.has_affect(flag)`. `MobInstance.has_affect()` already existed; no MobInstance gap.
- **DUPL-019 — consolidated 2 duplicate `_apply_wait_state` helpers onto new `mud/utils/timing.py:apply_wait_state(char, beats)`** (ROM WAIT_STATE: `ch->wait = max(ch->wait, beats)` from `src/skills.c`). `mud/commands/thief_skills.py` and `mud/commands/healer.py` now re-import the canonical helper.

## [2.9.30]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-007 — `mud/commands/imm_search.py` was importing the divergent `affect_loc_name` copy from `mud/handler.py`.** Fix-time re-audit invalidated the prior session's DEAD-CODE classification: `mud/handler.py:1302` mapped `APPLY_SPELL_AFFECT (25) → "spell affect"`, but ROM `src/handler.c:2718-2775` returns `"none"` for that location. The canonical (and ROM-faithful) copy lives at `mud/commands/affects.py:47`. Immortal `show`/`oset`/`sset` output (lines 807, 845, 1135 of `imm_search.py`) was printing the wrong location label for any affect with `APPLY_SPELL_AFFECT`. Redirected `imm_search.py` to import from `mud/commands/affects`; deleted the divergent `mud/handler.py:1302` def. Same Trojan-horse pattern as DUPL-001c. Surfaced by DUPL-007 in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

### Removed
- **DUPL-006 — deleted unused `mud/combat/safety.py:check_killer` stub.** 5-line stub that set `PlayerFlag.KILLER` with no ROM-faithful logic; `gitnexus_impact` returned 0 callers and grep confirmed only `is_safe` was imported from `safety.py`. The canonical `check_killer` (full ROM logic: charm chain, KILLER/THIEF gates) lives at `mud/combat/engine.py:1084` and is what all 4 production callers reach.

### Changed
- **DUPL-008 — reclassified as ✅ MATCH (intentional immortal-bypass).** `mud/world/char_find.py` versions (`get_char_room`/`get_char_world`) apply `can_see_character` visibility gating (used by 11+ gameplay paths). `mud/commands/imm_commands.py:55,89` versions skip visibility (used by 4 immortal paths: `imm_punish`, `imm_search`, `imm_display`, `communication`'s `tell`-with-immortal-target) so immortals can target hidden/invis/wizinvis characters. Documented in the audit doc's MATCH section.

## [2.9.29]

### Removed
- **`mud/loaders/json_area_loader.py` (244 lines) deleted as dead code (DUPL-005).** The DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS audit flagged two parallel JSON area loaders (`json_loader.py` and `json_area_loader.py`) with the same `load_area_from_json` / `load_all_areas_from_json` function names but different schemas and return types — a silent-divergence risk where import order would determine which loader fired. Investigation confirmed zero importers in `mud/` or `tests/` for `json_area_loader.py` (only mention was in `archive/specs/`). The live `json_loader.py` (re-exported via `mud/loaders/__init__.py` as the FULL loader with resets) already handles both on-disk JSON shapes (root-level `vnum_range.min/max` AND nested `{"area": {...}}` wrapper), so `json_area_loader.py` was a strict-subset dead duplicate. Same Trojan-horse pattern as the 2.9.21 `rom_api.py` deletion — dead module sitting next to canonical code, eligible for accidental activation. 33 area-loader tests remain green after deletion. Surfaced by DUPL-005 in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`. With this row closed, all 5 real-bug rows in the duplicate-implementations audit are now ✅ FIXED.

## [2.9.28]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-003 — `do_quaff` (and the immortal-load extract path) never removed potions/objects from inventory.** The local `_extract_obj` copies in `mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py` and `mud/commands/imm_load.py` were (a) non-recursive over container contents and (b) read `char.carrying` / `carrier.carrying` — a non-existent attribute on `Character` (canonical per AGENTS.md ROM Parity Rules is `char.inventory`). Result: every `do_quaff` printed the flavor text and cast the potion's spells, but the potion stayed in inventory — players could quaff the same potion infinitely. The non-recursive bug also leaked container contents: extracting a chest left its items dangling with `in_obj` still pointing at the (extracted) parent. Both copies now route through canonical `mud/game_loop.py:_extract_obj(obj)` which mirrors ROM `src/handler.c:2051 extract_obj` (recurse over `contains`, unlink from `in_room`/`carried_by`/`in_obj`, remove from `object_registry`). `obj_manipulation.py` retains a thin `(char, obj)` adapter that delegates to the canonical `(obj)`-only entry. Regression tests: `tests/integration/test_dupl_003_extract_obj.py` — `do_quaff` inventory removal + recursive container-contents extraction. Surfaced by DUPL-003 in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

## [2.9.27]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-001c — `mud/game_loop.py:_send_to_char` duplicate-delivered tick-driven messages to connected PCs.** Fix-time re-audit invalidated the prior session's "canonical-equivalent tidying only" classification: the copy did `asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))` AND `messages.append(...)` unconditionally (no early return after the async branch), so the canonical `push_message`-style single-delivery contract was broken. Every tick-driven message routed through this stub — plague/poison agony (`mud/game_loop.py:575`), light flicker/burnout (`:475,:477,:480`), decay-timer void teleport (`:523`), fever spread (`:609`), cold suffering (`:651`), and decay-broadcast messages (`:720,:1057,:1139`) — was delivered twice for connected players (async socket fires once, connection read loop's `char.messages` drain fires it again on the next command). Consolidated onto canonical `mud/utils/messaging.py:send_to_char_buffered`. With this fix, all 13 sites of DUPL-001 (`_send_to_char`) now route through the canonical implementation and the audit row flips to ✅ FIXED. Regression test: `tests/integration/test_dupl_001c_game_loop_no_duplicate.py` (single-delivery for connected PC + mailbox fallback for disconnected). Surfaced by DUPL-001c in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

## [2.9.26]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-001b — `combat/assist.py` and `skills/handlers.py` `_send_to_char` duplicate-delivered** to both async socket and `char.messages`. The connection read loop drains `char.messages` after the next command, so every assist message (combat group auto-assist emotes via `_broadcast_room`) and every skill-handler message (spell/skill outcome text) replayed once per prompt for connected PCs — the same single-delivery contract violation already fixed for DUPL-002 (`_push_message`) and DUPL-001 (conditions). Both stubs consolidated onto canonical `mud/utils/messaging.py:send_to_char_buffered`. `combat/assist.py:_broadcast_room` now appends `"\n"` at the call site to preserve the previous line-terminator behavior. Regression test: `tests/integration/test_dupl_001b_no_duplicate_delivery.py`. Surfaced by DUPL-001b in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

## [2.9.25]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-001a — 9 immortal/admin command modules wrote to `char.output_buffer` black hole** (`mud/commands/imm_load.py`, `imm_emote.py`, `imm_admin.py`, `imm_commands.py`, `imm_display.py`, `imm_punish.py`, `imm_server.py`, `admin_commands.py`, `remaining_rom.py`): each carried a byte-identical local `_send_to_char` stub that appended to `char.output_buffer` — an attribute the production connection read loop never drains. Every staff/admin message routed through those stubs (do_protect "You are now immune to snooping.", do_pmote emote text, do_guild clan changes, do_violate, etc.) vanished for connected staff and existed only in tests that read `output_buffer` directly. All 9 stubs consolidated onto canonical `mud/utils/messaging.py:send_to_char_buffered`. Two test files (`tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py`, `tests/integration/test_act_comm_gaps.py`) had been reading `output_buffer` to assert delivery — same Trojan-horse pattern as the rom_api.py deletion (tests validating divergent behavior). Migrated all 11 such asserts to read `messages` (the canonical fallback). Regression test: `tests/integration/test_imm_command_delivery_dupl_001a.py` pins that `output_buffer` is never created. Surfaced by DUPL-001a in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

## [2.9.24]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-001 (conditions.py) — hunger/thirst/sober messages never reached connected players** (`mud/characters/conditions.py`): the local `_send_to_char` stub appended ONLY to `char.messages`. The connection delivery path uses `asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))`, so the mailbox-only branch never reaches a connected PC's socket — players never saw "You are hungry." / "You are thirsty." / "You are sober." from the gain_condition tick. Audited and replaced with new canonical `mud.utils.messaging.send_to_char_buffered`, which mirrors ROM `src/comm.c:send_to_char` (async socket for connected, mailbox fallback for disconnected/tests — single delivery, no replay). Regression test: `tests/integration/test_gain_condition_delivers_to_connected_pc.py`. Surfaced by DUPL-001 in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

### Changed
- **DUPL-001 audit re-read surfaced a fresh bug class.** Re-reading the 13 `_send_to_char` bodies revealed **9 sites** (`imm_load.py`, `imm_emote.py`, `imm_admin.py`, `imm_commands.py`, `imm_display.py`, `imm_punish.py`, `imm_server.py`, `admin_commands.py`, `remaining_rom.py`) write to `char.output_buffer` — an attribute the production connection read loop never drains. Every immortal/admin message via those stubs vanishes. Plus `combat/assist.py` and `skills/handlers.py` carry the DUPL-002-class duplicate-delivery bug (write to BOTH async socket AND `char.messages`). Tracked as follow-up DUPL-001a (output_buffer black-hole, 9 sites), DUPL-001b (duplicate-delivery, 2 sites), DUPL-001c (game_loop canonical-equivalent, 1 site).

## [2.9.23]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-004 — `do_peek` skipped skill improvement + crashed on success** (`mud/commands/misc_player.py:do_peek`): ROM `src/act_info.c:505` calls `check_improve(ch, gsn_peek, TRUE, 4)` after a successful peek roll. Python had a local `pass`-body `_check_improve` stub silently skipping improvement, and a function-level `from mud.core.dice import number_percent` referencing a non-existent module — any successful peek attempt would have raised `ModuleNotFoundError`. Rewrote the call site to use canonical `mud.skills.registry.check_improve` with `multiplier=4` per ROM, and `mud.utils.rng_mm.number_percent` per ROM Parity Rules. Two other dead `_check_improve` stubs (in `mud/commands/thief_skills.py` and `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py`) deleted — re-verification of the audit row showed `do_sneak`/`do_hide` already delegate to `mud/skills/handlers.py` (canonical), and `remaining_rom.py` had no internal call at all. Regression test: `tests/integration/test_do_peek_check_improve.py` (success + failure branches assert call/no-call of canonical `check_improve`). Surfaced by DUPL-004 in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`.

## [2.9.22]

### Fixed
- **DUPL-002 — `_push_message` duplicate-delivery in magic effects** (`mud/magic/effects.py`): the magic-effects copy of `_push_message` appended to BOTH the async socket send and `char.messages`. For connected PCs the connection read loop drains `char.messages` after the next command, so every magic effect message (poison ticks, plague chills, paralyze, etc.) replayed once per prompt — the same duplicate-delivery class that `mud/combat/engine.py:_push_message` already fixed. Consolidated to a single canonical implementation at `mud/utils/messaging.py:push_message`; both `combat/engine.py` and `magic/effects.py` now re-export it. Existing `from mud.combat.engine import _push_message` callers continue to work. Regression test: `tests/integration/test_magic_effect_message_no_duplicate.py`. Surfaced by the DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS audit (DUPL-002 row in `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`).

### Added
- `docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md` — first per-class audit under the META_AUDIT_TAXONOMY plan. 67 same-name same-primitive duplicate defs in `mud/` enumerated; classified as 5 ❌ real parity bugs (`_send_to_char` messages-only fallback, `_push_message` double-delivery, `_extract_obj` non-recursive + wrong attribute, `_check_improve` triple-stub blocking skill improvement, `load_area_from_json` divergent JSON schemas), 3 ⚠️ DEAD-CODE rows, ~20 ⚠️ CLEANUP rows, 4 ✅ intentional, 5 closed by 2.9.21 rom_api.py deletion. Burn-down order documented; DUPL-002 (`_push_message`) recommended as the narrowest first fix.

## [2.9.21]

### Removed
- **`mud/rom_api.py` (690 lines, 30 functions) and `tests/test_rom_api.py` (16 tests) deleted.** The module was created on 2025-12-23 as "public wrapper functions for ROM C compatibility… for external tools and documentation," but the external-tools use case never materialized in the five months since. Of its 30 functions, the audit found three categories: (1) thin wrappers delegating to canonical implementations (harmless), (2) dead-signature commands that couldn't reach the dispatcher (`do_imotd`/`do_rules`/`do_story` had `(char) -> str` while dispatcher requires `(char, args) -> str`), and (3) wrong stubs whose tests validated divergent behavior as if it were correct (`get_max_train` returned `min(21, 25)` ignoring race/class while `mud/handler.py:get_max_train` correctly walks `PC_RACE_TABLE`). Category (3) was the worst case — every CI run for five months was confirming wrong behavior in a dead module while the right code ran in production, creating false parity signal. Surfaced as the headline finding of the DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS audit (Class 6 of `docs/parity/META_AUDIT_TAXONOMY.md`).

### Changed
- `check_blind` (only `rom_api.py` function with a production import — `mud/world/look.py:56`) relocated to `mud/world/vision.py` next to the rest of visibility logic.
- `recursive_clone` (used by the INV-014 integration test) relocated to `mud/models/object.py` next to `create_object`. Behavior unchanged.

## [2.9.20]

### Fixed
- **`do_group` missing TO_VICT / TO_NOTVICT broadcasts on add/remove** (`mud/commands/group_commands.py:do_group`): ROM `src/act_obj.c... src/act_comm.c:1850-1854` (add) emits three messages — `$N joins $n's group.` (TO_NOTVICT, onlookers), `You join $n's group.` (TO_VICT, the joined victim), `$N joins your group.` (TO_CHAR, the leader). The remove path at `:1841-1846` is symmetric: `$n removes $N from $s group.` / `$n removes you from $s group.` / `You remove $N from your group.`. Python returned only the TO_CHAR string, so victims never learned they had been added to (or removed from) a group, and onlookers never saw membership changes. Fix: emit ROM-shaped messages on both branches via `messages.append(...)`, iterating room occupants for TO_NOTVICT. One enforcement test in `tests/integration/test_do_group_notification.py` covering the add path (victim TO_VICT + onlooker TO_NOTVICT + leader/follower state).

## [2.9.19]

### Fixed
- **`do_follow` missing master/follower notification broadcasts** (`mud/commands/group_commands.py:add_follower / stop_follower`): ROM `src/act_comm.c:1602-1605 add_follower` emits `$n now follows you.` to the master (gated on `can_see`) and `You now follow $N.` to the follower; `src/act_comm.c:1626-1630 stop_follower` emits the symmetric `$n stops following you.` / `You stop following $N.` (gated on `can_see && in_room != NULL`). Python's `add_follower` / `stop_follower` in `mud/commands/group_commands.py` — the variants the command dispatcher actually uses (`mud/commands/dispatcher.py:114,320`) — were silent on both sides, so masters never learned when someone began or stopped following them. (A second canonical copy in `mud/characters/follow.py` already had the broadcasts, but it's not the one wired to `do_follow`.) Fix: add ROM-shaped messages to both `add_follower` and `stop_follower` in `group_commands.py`, gated by `can_see_character` to match ROM's `can_see (master, ch)` conjunction. One enforcement test in `tests/integration/test_do_follow_master_notification.py` covering both sides of the follow handshake. Duplicate-implementations sweep (consolidating onto the canonical `mud/characters/follow.py`) deferred — out of scope for this single-gap fix.

## [2.9.18]

### Fixed
- **`do_buy` missing `$n buys $p.` TO_ROOM broadcast** (`mud/commands/shop.py:836-846`): ROM `src/act_obj.c:2734-2745 do_buy` emits `$n buys $p[N].` (multi) or `$n buys $p.` (single) to the room before deducting cost, so onlookers see the purchase. Python's `do_buy` had zero room broadcasts — the buyer received their TO_CHAR confirmation but no witness in the room saw the transaction. ROM-divergent. (Sibling `do_sell` at `mud/commands/shop.py:938-942` already had the matching `$n sells $p.` broadcast.) Fix: emit the broadcast via `room.broadcast(..., exclude=char)` before `deduct_cost`, mirroring ROM ordering and `do_sell`'s established pattern. Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_shop_room_broadcasts.py`: (1) witness in same room sees `$n buys $p.` after buy, buyer excluded; (2) regression-pin for the pre-existing `do_sell` broadcast so it can't silently regress.

## [2.9.17]

### Fixed
- **`do_say` / `do_tell` missing `!IS_NPC(ch)` gate on SPEECH trigger loop** (`mud/commands/communication.py:140-175`, `:178-241`): ROM `src/act_comm.c:779` (`do_say`) and `:946` (`do_tell`) only enter the SPEECH listener loop when the speaker is a PC: `if (!IS_NPC (ch)) { ... }` and `if (!IS_NPC (ch) && IS_NPC (victim) && HAS_TRIGGER (victim, TRIG_SPEECH))`. The gate is load-bearing: it prevents mob-to-mob speech-trigger cascades (mob A says "X" → mob B's SPEECH trigger fires `mob say "Y"` → mob A's trigger fires → infinite loop). Python's listener loop was unconditional — any NPC who called `do_say` or `do_tell` (e.g. via `mud/agent/character_agent.py`, or any future agent-driven mob path) would fire SPEECH triggers on other NPCs. Fix: gate both listener loops on `not getattr(char, "is_npc", False)` (and `do_tell`'s also requires `getattr(target, "is_npc", False)`, matching ROM's compound conjunction). Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_npc_speaker_does_not_trigger_speech.py`: (1) NPC speaker via `do_say` does not fire SPEECH on listening NPC; (2) NPC teller via `do_tell` does not fire SPEECH on NPC target.

## [2.9.16]

### Added
- **INV-019 POSITION-PROMOTION-ON-HEAL** filed as ✅ ENFORCED in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`. ROM `src/fight.c:1380-1387 update_pos` — when `victim->hit > 0`, if `position <= POS_STUNNED` the victim is **silently** promoted to `POS_STANDING` (no `act()` call, no self-line). This is the upward counterpart of INV-016 BCAST-ON-POSITION-TRANSITION (which fires only on the downward damage path). The contract spans three modules: heal handlers (`mud/skills/handlers.py` — `cure_light`, `cure_critical`, `cure_serious`, `heal`), the regen pipeline (`mud/game_loop.py:char_update` lines 713-716 — `_apply_regeneration` then `update_pos` only when STUNNED), and `update_pos` itself (`mud/combat/engine.py:677-697`, byte-for-byte ROM). All three currently agree by construction; the test pins three load-bearing properties: (1) cure_light on a STUNNED PC promotes to STANDING with no broadcast, (2) the regen tick promotes a STUNNED char whose hp lifts above 0, (3) `update_pos` does not promote positions above STUNNED (RESTING stays RESTING). `tests/integration/test_inv019_position_promotion_on_heal.py`. Tracker now at 19 of ~20 budget.

## [2.9.15]

### Fixed
- **`group_gain` over-counted level-1 NPC contributions to `total_levels`** (`mud/groups/xp.py:104-105`): ROM `src/fight.c:1751` accumulates `group_levels += IS_NPC(gch) ? gch->level / 2 : gch->level;` — raw C integer division, so a level-1 NPC group member (e.g. a charmed pet) contributes 0, not 1. Python had `total_levels += max(1, level // 2)`, flooring NPC contributions at 1. Symptom: a level-10 PC grouped with a level-1 charmed pet killed a victim and received ~10% less XP than ROM would award, because the share-formula denominator (`max(1, total_levels - 1)`, `mud/groups/xp.py:253-254`) was inflated by 1. Fix: drop the `max(1, ...)` floor. Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_group_xp_npc_level_floor.py`: (1) level-1 NPC pet contributes 0; (2) level-3 NPC pet contributes 1 (sanity check that the original behavior at level ≥ 2 is preserved).

## [2.9.14]

### Fixed
- **INV-018 WEAR-OFF-MESSAGE-FOR-RAW-AFFECT — raw `AffectData` expiries silent in Python** (`mud/affects/engine.py:tick_spell_effects`, new helper `_lookup_raw_affect_wear_off`): ROM `src/update.c:777-781` emits `skill_table[paf->type].msg_off` to the character whenever any positive-typed affect's duration reaches 0 — keyed off the spell SN against the skill_table, not off the `AFFECT_DATA` struct itself. Python's `tick_spell_effects` only emitted a wear-off message when the expiring affect's name appeared in the `spell_effects` dict (the `apply_spell_effect` shadow-mirror path). Raw `AffectData` entries — written straight to `character.affected` via `affect_to_char` without a parallel `apply_spell_effect` call — wore off silently. The production trigger is plague spread at `mud/game_loop.py:614-624`, which builds an `AffectData(type="plague", …)` from constants and calls `vch.affect_to_char(new_af)`; the victim's plague tick then expires silently instead of emitting the skill_table msg_off line (`"Your sores vanish."` per `data/skills.json`). Same applies to any future call path that bypasses `apply_spell_effect`. Fix mirrors the precedent at `mud/game_loop.py:1121-1131 _broadcast_object_wear_off` (object affects use the same hybrid pattern): prefer an explicit `wear_off_message` attribute on the affect, then fall back to `skill_registry.get(affect.type).messages["wear_off"]`. Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_inv018_wear_off_message_for_raw_affect.py`: (1) dynamic `wear_off_message` attribute on the affect must surface; (2) absent that attribute, the registry fallback must fire with the ROM-canonical msg_off string from `data/skills.json`. Tracker now at 18 of ~20 budget; INV-001 … INV-018 all ✅ ENFORCED.

## [2.9.13]

### Added
- **INV-017 TICK-ITERATION-SAFETY** filed as ✅ ENFORCED in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`. ROM `src/update.c:char_update` (lines 661-872) pre-caches `ch_next = ch->next` (line 680) so the outer loop survives any lethal damage applied inside the per-char tick — plague/poison/incap/mortal branches all call `damage(ch, ch, ...)` which routes to `raw_kill` and frees `ch`. The explicit comment at lines 788-792 ("MUST NOT refer to ch after damage taken, as it may be lethal damage (on NPC)") plus the post-loop `IS_VALID(ch)` guard at line 884 form the load-bearing contract. Python's `mud/game_loop.py:char_update` already enforces this by iterating `for character in list(character_registry):` (line 690) — the `list(...)` snapshot decouples iteration from `character_registry.remove()` calls made by `mud/combat/death.py:raw_kill`. Regression test pins it: a poisoned NPC at 1 hp dies during its poison tick; the subsequent NPC in the snapshot must still receive its tick (proves the loop did not break or skip after the registry mutation). `tests/integration/test_char_update_lethal_tick_iteration.py::test_lethal_poison_tick_does_not_skip_subsequent_npc`. Tracker now at 17 of ~20 budget.

## [2.9.12]

### Fixed
- **`die_follower` left dangling leader pointers + skipped self-cleanup** (`mud/characters/follow.py:die_follower`): ROM `src/act_comm.c:1658-1680` does three things on a character's death — (1) detaches the dying ch from its own master (releasing `master->pet` if it pointed at ch), (2) clears `ch->leader`, (3) walks `char_list` and for every `fch` whose `master == ch` stops the follow AND for every `fch` whose `leader == ch` resets `fch->leader = fch` (becomes its own group leader, NOT NULL). The Python port previously only did step 3's first half (`master == ch` → `stop_follower`). Symptom: after a group leader died, `is_same_group` (`src/handler.c:2018-2027`, walks `leader` pointers) still equated two unrelated survivors because both still pointed at the extracted corpse — breaking group XP routing, autoassist target filtering, and `do_group` membership checks. Also, a dying ch retained its own master/leader pointers, leaving the corpse "still in" a group from the surviving leader's perspective. Fix mirrors ROM exactly. Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_die_follower_leader_chain.py`: (1) leader dies → ex-members become own leaders and are no longer `is_same_group` with each other; (2) follower dies → `ch.master`, `ch.leader`, and `master.pet` all cleared.

## [2.9.11]

### Fixed
- **HPCNT-001 — `TRIG_HPCNT` over-fired inside `_apply_damage`** (`mud/combat/engine.py:603-606` pre-removal): ROM's only `mp_hprct_trigger` call site is `src/fight.c:97` inside `violence_update`, which fires it once per pulse per NPC after `multi_hit` on the NPC attacker. ROM `damage()` (`src/fight.c:825-870`) does NOT fire HPCNT on the victim. The Python `_apply_damage` carried a `if victim_is_npc and victim.hit > 0: mp_hprct_trigger(victim, attacker)` block with a misattributed `ROM Reference: src/fight.c:1094-1136` comment — that range is `is_safe_spell`, not HPCNT. Symptom: HP-percent mob scripts that gate on `hpcnt N` fired N+1 times per `multi_hit` (once per landed hit plus once at multi_hit's end), and also fired on spell-damage paths where ROM doesn't fire HPCNT at all. Deleted the `_apply_damage` block; the canonical site at `mud/combat/engine.py:388-390` (end of `multi_hit`, NPC attacker only) remains and continues to mirror ROM `src/fight.c:91-98`. Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_hpcnt_once_per_pulse.py`: (1) PC attacker on NPC victim runs `attack_round` and HPCNT must fire 0 times; (2) NPC attacker on PC victim runs `multi_hit` with 2nd/3rd-attack skills at 100% and HPCNT must fire exactly once.

## [2.9.10]

### Fixed
- **INV-016 BCAST-ON-POSITION-TRANSITION — spell-induced position transitions silent to the room** (`mud/combat/engine.py:apply_position_change`, every damage-spell site in `mud/skills/handlers.py`): ROM `src/fight.c:damage` funnels every damage path through `update_pos` then `act()`-broadcasts the "X is incapacitated" / "X is mortally wounded" / "X is DEAD!!" line per `src/fight.c:837-861`. `mud/combat/engine.py:apply_damage` does this correctly, but 16 damage-spell handlers in `mud/skills/handlers.py` did `target.hit -= damage; update_pos(target)` directly — bypassing the broadcast. Extracted `mud/combat/engine.py:apply_position_change(victim, old_pos)` as the shared enforcement point (delegates the room broadcast via `_position_change_message` and the to-self line via `_push_message` when `victim.position != old_pos`); `_apply_damage` now calls it. Each damage spell that bypasses `apply_damage` (acid_blast, acid_breath, burning_hands, call_lightning, chill_touch, colour_spray, demonfire, dispel_evil, dispel_good, fire_breath, frost_breath, gas_breath, harm, heat_metal, lightning_breath, shocking_grasp) now captures `old_pos = target.position` before the `hit -=` and calls `apply_position_change(target, old_pos)` after `update_pos`. Heal sites (`cure_*`, `heal`) intentionally skip the helper — ROM's broadcast block lives in `damage()`, not on upward STUNNED → STANDING transitions. `cause_*` already routes through `apply_damage` and inherits the broadcast there. INV-016 row in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` flipped ❌ BROKEN → ✅ ENFORCED; xfail in `tests/integration/test_inv016_position_transition_broadcast.py` removed, test now passes strict.

## [2.9.9]

### Added
- **INV-016 BCAST-ON-POSITION-TRANSITION** filed in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` with status ❌ BROKEN. ROM `src/fight.c:damage` broadcasts the per-position room line ("X is incapacitated", "X is mortally wounded", "X is DEAD!!" per `src/fight.c:837-861`) after every hp drop that crosses a threshold. The Python port has two damage code-paths: `mud/combat/engine.py:apply_damage` does broadcast correctly (combat hits, traps), but ~18 damage-spell handlers in `mud/skills/handlers.py` (acid_blast, fire_breath, harm, energy_drain, cause_*, etc.) do `target.hit -= damage; update_pos(target)` directly — bypassing `apply_damage`, so spell-induced INCAP/MORTAL/DEAD transitions are silent to the room. Sibling of INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY but inverted (*zero-delivery*). Documenting test at `tests/integration/test_inv016_position_transition_broadcast.py` is marked `xfail(strict=True)` — flip to passing when the routing fix lands. Closing this is a separate cluster (~18 spell sites + breath weapons + harm).

## [2.9.8]

### Removed
- **Dead `Character.affect_remove` method** (`mud/models/character.py:862-880` pre-removal): zero callers and a dormant variant of the INV-015 bug — it cleared the bitvector with a "still-has" sweep but never called `affect_modify(False)`, so any future caller would have leaked stat modifiers identically to the pre-2.9.7 tick path. Use the module-level `mud/handler.py:affect_remove(ch, paf)` instead — it mirrors `src/handler.c:1317` exactly. Sibling sweep on the INV-015 surface; no production behavior change (zero call sites at the time of removal, verified via `grep -rn "\.affect_remove("`).

## [2.9.7]

### Fixed
- **INV-015 AFFECT-TICK-LIFECYCLE — expired ROM-canonical affects leaked stat modifiers and bitvectors** (`mud/affects/engine.py:tick_spell_effects`, `mud/handler.py:affect_remove`): ROM `src/update.c:762-786 affect_update` calls `src/handler.c:1317 affect_remove` on expiry, which `affect_modify(FALSE)` (subtracts the stat mod, clears the bitvector) → unlinks from `ch->affected` → calls `affect_check` (re-sets the bit only if another affect still provides it). The Python tick path was a bare `affected.remove(affect)` — no stat unwind, no bitvector clear. Symptom for any `AffectData` whose `type` is the ROM-canonical integer spell SN (the `isinstance(spell_name, str)` guard at engine.py:32 skipped the `spell_effects` cleanup branch for these): permanent stat boosts and phantom `affected_by` bits after every expiry. Fix: new module-level `mud/handler.py:affect_remove(ch, paf)` mirrors `src/handler.c:1317` exactly. `tick_spell_effects` routes raw ROM-canonical entries through it. **Spell-effects-managed entries (the `apply_spell_effect` shadow-mirror path used by frenzy/bless/weaken/etc.) keep bare list removal** — `remove_spell_effect` already handles their stat unwind; double-routing would double-unwind (caught by `tests/integration/test_spell_affects_persistence.py` + `tests/test_affects.py` regressions during implementation, hence the split).
- INV-015 row added to `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, ✅ ENFORCED. Two enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_inv015_affect_tick_lifecycle.py` — stat-modifier unwind, and bitvector preservation when a second affect provides the same bit (mirrors ROM `affect_check`).

## [2.9.6]

### Added
- **End-to-end decay-loop coverage for INV-012 / INV-013 / INV-014** (`tests/integration/test_decay_loop_inv012.py`): three new integration tests pin the registry/carrier/carry-counter contracts as they cross the `obj_update` → `_extract_obj` boundary. (1) A carried potion whose timer expires must be removed from `object_registry` (INV-014), removed from the carrier's inventory, and the `carry_weight` / `carry_number` counters must drop (INV-011). (2) ROM `src/handler.c:2063-2067 extract_obj` recurses through container contents — verified with an NPC corpse containing a pouch containing a ruby; all three leave the registry on the corpse's decay tick. (3) Downstream INV-014 consequence — a decayed obj is no longer findable via `locate object` (it walked the registry). Fills coverage gaps the pre-existing `test_obj_update_decays_corpse` and `test_obj_update_spills_floating_container` did not exercise.

## [2.9.5]

### Fixed
- **`Character.equip_object` did not set `obj.carried_by`** (`mud/models/character.py:547`): ROM `src/handler.c equip_char` leaves the carrier field set — equipped objs stay owned by the carrier, only `wear_loc` changes. The Python helper updated the equipment dict but never touched `carried_by`, so an obj equipped directly (e.g. via `caster.equip_object(disc, "float")` in `floating_disc`) ended up in the slot with `carried_by=None`, violating INV-013.
- **`Character.remove_object` did not clear `obj.carried_by`** (`mud/models/character.py:556`): ROM `src/handler.c:1642 obj_from_char` clears the carrier back-pointer atomically with the extraction. The Python helper removed from inventory/equipment and updated counters but left `carried_by` pointing at the (now-former) carrier — stale back-pointer that would surface as a wrong-carrier report in `locate object`, save serialization, or any INV-013-aware code. Defensive `getattr` guard handles the small number of legacy tests that pass `SimpleNamespace` stand-ins instead of real `Object` instances.
- INV-013 row "Touched by" trail extended to record the equip / remove enforcement points. 3 new enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_inv013_add_object_carrier.py` (now 6 total covering the full add / equip / remove cycle).

## [2.9.4]

### Fixed
- **`Character.add_object` did not set `obj.carried_by`** (`mud/models/character.py:542`): ROM `src/handler.c:1626 obj_to_char` sets `obj->carried_by = ch` atomically with the inventory append. The Python helper updated `inventory` + carry counters but left the canonical INV-013 carrier field as `None`, so every direct `add_object` caller silently produced an inventory item with no back-pointer to its carrier. Fix: `add_object` now sets `obj.location = self` (INV-013 property dispatch sets `carried_by` and clears `in_room` / `in_obj`).
- **`do_mpoload` bypassed `Character.add_object` entirely** (`mud/mob_cmds.py:651-655`, ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:603-607 → src/handler.c:1626 obj_to_char`): the inventory-mode branch did `inventory.append(obj)`, missing both the INV-013 `carried_by` field AND the INV-011 carry counters. Every MOBprog `mob oload <vnum>` left the script-mob's `carry_weight` and `carry_number` unchanged, so encumbrance skewed every time a mob scripted an item load. Fix: route through `ch.add_object(obj)`.
- Surfaced via the INV-012 follow-up scan of `do_mpoload`; existing `test_mob_cmds_oload.py` only checked `obj.level` and inventory membership, never asserting `carried_by` or carry counters. New `tests/integration/test_inv013_add_object_carrier.py` pins both behaviors (3 tests).

## [2.9.3]

### Added
- **`INV-014` — OBJECT-REGISTRY-MEMBERSHIP locked in** (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, `tests/integration/test_inv014_object_registry_membership.py`): ROM `src/db.c:create_object` appends every freshly built `OBJ_DATA` to the global `object_list` unconditionally — every world-scan consumer (`src/magic.c:3737 spell_locate_object`, decay sweep, save) walks that list. Previously only `mud/spawning/obj_spawner.py:spawn_object` appended to `mud.models.obj.object_registry`; six other production sites built `Object` instances without registering, leaving freshly-created corpses, gore objects, money piles, shop clones, and DB-restored inventory invisible to `locate object`. Added `mud.models.object.create_object(prototype, *, instance_id=None)` as the canonical factory (appends and returns); routed every production construction site through it. `mud/skills/handlers.py:_iterate_world_objects` now walks `object_registry` first, computing the holder per ROM `src/magic.c:3747` (outermost `in_obj` chain → `carried_by` → `in_room` → `None` rendered as "somewhere"); a legacy room/character walk remains as a compat backstop for unit tests. Eight enforcement tests cover every construction path plus the homeless-object locate symptom.

### Fixed
- **`spell_locate_object` could not find homeless objects** (`mud/skills/handlers.py:_iterate_world_objects`): an object spawned but not yet placed (`in_room=None, carried_by=None, in_obj=None`) was skipped entirely, while ROM `src/magic.c:3756-3762` reports it as "one is in somewhere" (the `in_room == NULL` branch). Iterator now walks `object_registry` so registered-but-unplaced objects surface at parity with ROM.
- **Six production sites built `Object` instances without registering** (handler.py, combat/death.py ×2, rom_api.py, commands/shop.py fallback, models/conversion.py): `create_money`, `_fallback_gore`, `_fallback_corpse`, `recursive_clone`, `_clone_inventory_object` (when `spawn_object` returned `None`), and `load_objects_for_character` all bypassed `object_registry`. ROM `create_object` always appends. All six now route through `create_object` (or `spawn_object` where applicable).

## [2.9.2]

### Added
- **`INV-013` — OBJECT-LOCATION-COHERENCE locked in** (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, `tests/integration/test_inv013_object_location_coherence.py`): `Object.location` is no longer a stored field — it is now a property dispatching to the three canonical ROM container fields (`in_room`, `carried_by`, `in_obj`) per `src/handler.c:1626 obj_to_char` / `1953 obj_to_room` / `1968 obj_to_obj`. Setting `location` to a Room/Character/Object sets the matching ROM field and clears the other two; setting it to None clears all three; reads return whichever ROM field is non-None. Eliminates the latent divergence where callers had to remember to update both `obj.location` and `obj.in_room`. Seven enforcement tests.

### Fixed
- **`MobInstance.add_to_inventory` cleared `carried_by` right after setting it** (`mud/spawning/templates.py:445-446`): the method did `obj.carried_by = self; obj.location = None`. Pre-INV-013 the second line was a redundant legacy-field reset; under the new dispatch it cleared the carried_by we just set. Deleted the redundant `obj.location = None` line. Surfaced as a P-reset regression (`tests/test_spawning.py::test_reset_P_fills_mob_carried_container`) when the reset_handler could no longer find the mob-carried container.
- **`make_corpse` left money objects with no container linkage** (`mud/combat/death.py:441`): money was appended to `corpse.contained_items` but `money_obj.location` was set to None, leaving `money_obj.in_obj` unset. Per ROM `src/handler.c:1968 obj_to_obj`, money inside a corpse must have `in_obj = corpse`. Changed to `money_obj.location = corpse`.
- **Two `act_wiz` parity tests passed `location=-1` to the `Object` constructor** (`tests/integration/test_act_wiz_command_parity.py:398,582`): a Room or None was expected; `-1` was a stale placeholder from earlier refactors. Removed the kwarg — the tests already set `obj.in_room = room` on the next line.

## [2.9.1]

### Fixed
- **`test_wait_and_daze_decrement_on_violence_pulse` — long-standing red test was asserting non-ROM behavior** (`tests/test_game_loop_wait_daze.py:27`, ROM `src/comm.c:616-621` + `src/fight.c:191-196`): the test created a `Character` without a descriptor and expected wait/daze to decrement by 1 per `game_tick`. ROM's descriptor input loop (`comm.c:616-621`) decrements only for characters with a `d->character` descriptor; descriptor-less actors decrement in `PULSE_VIOLENCE`-sized chunks via `violence_update` (`fight.c:191-196`). Fix: add `ch.desc = object()` to the test fixture so it exercises the descriptor path it was clearly written for. Renamed to `test_wait_and_daze_decrement_per_pulse_for_connected_character` to match its actual contract. Per AGENTS.md "a test asserting non-ROM behavior is a bug in the test, not the implementation."

## [2.9.0]

### Added
- **`INV-012` — OBJECT-LIST-CANONICAL locked in** (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, `tests/integration/test_inv012_object_list_canonical.py`): single canonical `Object` runtime class. `mud.models.obj.ObjectData` deleted. `object_registry` is now populated at spawn (`mud/spawning/obj_spawner.py:spawn_object`) and drained at extract (`mud/game_loop.py:_extract_obj`, including recursive contents per ROM `src/handler.c:2063-2067`). New ROM-named fields on `Object`: `in_room`, `in_obj`, `carried_by` (dataclass fields with `compare=False` to avoid `__eq__` graph recursion), `pIndexData` (read+write `@property` aliased to `prototype`), `contains` (read-only `@property` aliased to `contained_items`). Eight enforcement tests + smoke tests for `get_obj_world` and `obj_update`.

### Fixed
- **`object_registry` was never populated in production** (now-live behavior): every iteration over the global instance list was a no-op before this consolidation, silently disabling locate-object spells (`mud/world/obj_find.py:get_obj_world`, `mud/magic/effects.py`), mobprog oload triggers (`mud/mobprog.py`), global object scans (`mud/skills/handlers.py`), music decay (`mud/music/__init__.py`), and object decay tick (`mud/game_loop.py:obj_update`). Surfaced and closed under INV-012 — six smoke + correctness tests gate the behavior; per-system end-to-end coverage deferred to follow-up sessions.

### Changed
- ~12 `isinstance(target, ObjectData)` / `isinstance(target, (Object, ObjectData))` branches across `mud/skills/handlers.py` and `mud/game_loop.py` collapsed to `Object`-only.
- 17 helper signatures in `mud/game_loop.py` and 3 in `mud/handler.py` re-typed from `ObjectData` to `Object`. 4 dual-shape `getattr(obj, "contained_items", None) or getattr(obj, "contains", [])` fallbacks in `mud/game_loop.py` collapsed.
- `mud/mob_cmds.py:_extract_runtime_object` dead `isinstance(obj, ObjectData)` dispatch branch removed; local cleanup is the single canonical path.
- 35 test fixtures across 9 test files migrated from `ObjectData(item_type=X, ...)` to `Object(instance_id=None, prototype=ObjIndex(...))`.
- `tests/conftest.py` adds an autouse fixture that snapshots/clears/restores `object_registry` between tests, preventing leakage from the 10 test files that use `spawn_object`.

### Removed
- `mud.models.obj.ObjectData` (the dual-class runtime). Re-export dropped from `mud.models.__init__`.

## [2.8.79]

### Added
- **`INV-011` — CARRY-WEIGHT-COHERENCE locked in** (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, `tests/integration/test_inv011_carry_weight_coherence.py`): new cross-file invariant codifies that `ch.carry_weight` / `ch.carry_number` stay in lockstep with `ch.inventory + ch.equipment.values()` after every mutation path. ROM mirrors via `src/handler.c:1626 obj_to_char` / `1642 obj_from_char`. Five enforcement tests cover the canonical helpers (`Character.add_object` / `equip_object` / `remove_object`) and the runtime extract paths.

### Fixed
- **`_extract_obj` left stale carry counters on the carrier** (`mud/game_loop.py:784 _remove_from_character`, ROM `src/handler.c:2051 → 1642 obj_from_char`): the runtime extract path used by `_extract_obj`, corpse decay, and light-source decay removed the obj from `character.inventory` / `character.equipment` but never re-derived `carry_weight` or decremented `carry_number`. Every extract on a carried object skewed encumbrance upward; over a long-running session a player could become permanently over-encumbered with zero visible items. Fix: after the inventory/equipment removal, call `_recalculate_carry_weight()` and subtract the obj's `_object_carry_number` slot cost. Surfaced and closed under INV-011.

### Watch list
- New cross-file watch item: dual `Object` (`mud/models/object.py`) vs `ObjectData` (`mud/models/obj.py`) runtime classes — `object_registry: list[ObjectData]` is never populated because `spawn_object` constructs `Object`. Every iteration over `object_registry` (mobprog oload triggers, `get_obj_world`, locate-object spells, object decay) is a no-op in production. Parallel shape to INV-008. Tracked in `CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` watch list pending a multi-session consolidation strategy.

## [2.8.78]

### Added
- **`INV-010` — ROOM-PEOPLE-COHERENCE locked in** (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`, `tests/integration/test_inv010_room_people_coherence.py`): new cross-file invariant codifies the bidirectional contract between `char.room` and `room.people`. Six enforcement tests exercise the canonical helpers (`Room.add_character` / `Room.remove_character`), the `char_to_room` NULL → temple fallback, the imm_commands `_char_from_room` / `_char_to_room` duplicates, `MobInstance.move_to_room`, the raw `room.people.remove/append` pattern from `do_recall`, and a global registry sweep.

### Fixed
- **Dual `room_registry` divergence** (`mud/models/room.py:204`, ROM `src/db.c:get_room_index`): `mud.models.room` declared a second `room_registry` dict that the world loader never populated. `char_to_room`'s temple fallback (`mud/models/room.py:67`) and `mud/game_loop.py:525`'s limbo lookup read from this empty dict and silently no-oped — a NULL-room redirect dropped the character on the floor with `ch.room = None` instead of routing to `ROOM_VNUM_TEMPLE`. Fix: re-export the canonical `mud.registry.room_registry` from `mud/models/room.py` so both readers see the world-loaded table. Surfaced and closed under INV-010.

## [2.8.77]

### Fixed
- **`TRAIN-001` — `do_train` listing branch crashed on unrecognized args** (`mud/commands/advancement.py:315-324`, ROM `src/act_move.c:1713-1745`): any `train <typo>` (e.g. `train magic`, `train magic missile`) routed through the listing branch and raised `AttributeError: 'Character' object has no attribute 'perm_str'`. ROM reads `ch->perm_stat[STAT_*]`; QuickMUD stores the same data on `char.perm_stat: list[int]` — there are no `perm_str`/`perm_int`/`perm_wis`/`perm_dex`/`perm_con` attributes on `Character`. Fix: index `char.perm_stat` by STAT_STR..STAT_CON (0..4) for the max-stat comparison. Tests: `tests/test_advancement.py::test_train_lists_available_stats_without_crash`, `::test_train_lists_only_unmaxed_stats`.

## [2.8.76]

### Fixed
- **`CAST-001` — `do_cast` target resolution honors ROM `TAR_*` dispatch** (`mud/commands/combat.py:704`, ROM `src/magic.c:301-536`): `do_cast` previously defaulted `target = char` whenever no target arg was given, regardless of the spell's target type. Casting `'magic missile'` mid-combat (offensive spell, `ch->fighting != NULL`, no explicit victim) hit the caster instead of the fighting victim (`Your magic missile scratches you.`). Fix: dispatch on `skill.target` against the ROM `TAR_*` matrix — `"victim"` / `"character_or_object"` (TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE / TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF) default to `char.fighting` and error `"Cast the spell on whom?"` if not fighting; `"friendly"` (TAR_CHAR_DEFENSIVE) defaults to self; `"self"` / `"ignore"` (TAR_CHAR_SELF / TAR_IGNORE) bind to the caster. Object-only and PK-gate paths are noted as scope-deferred in `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md`. Tests: `tests/test_skills_spells_cast_listing.py::test_do_cast_offensive_no_target_defaults_to_fighting_victim`, `::test_do_cast_offensive_no_target_no_fight_errors`.

### Docs
- Added `docs/parity/MAGIC_C_AUDIT.md` as a stub for the eventual full `magic.c` audit; currently tracks only `CAST-001 ✅ FIXED` plus scope notes for object-targeted spells and PK gates.

## [2.8.75]

### Fixed
- **`do_cast` failed to dispatch handlers and resolve targets** (`mud/commands/combat.py:704-805`, ROM `src/magic.c:299-360`): three latent bugs the `2.8.74` `find_spell` fix exposed —
  - Handler lookup used `getattr(skill, "handler", None)`, which is always `None` because `SkillRegistry` stores handlers in `skill_registry.handlers[name]` rather than on the `Skill` object. Every cast therefore returned `"The spell '<name>' is not fully implemented yet."` Fixed to read from `skill_registry.handlers.get(skill.name)`.
  - Handler call passed three arguments (`spell_func(char, target, spell_level)`) but every entry in `mud/skills/handlers.py` is `(caster, target=None)`. The `TypeError` was swallowed by the broad `except` and returned as `"Spell cast failed: …"`. Fixed by matching the canonical `(caster, target)` signature used by `skill_registry.use()`.
  - Target lookup iterated `getattr(room, "characters", [])`, but the `Room` model stores occupants on `room.people`. Result: `cast magic missile fido` silently self-targeted. Fixed by iterating `room.people`.
  - `do_cast` also passed the handler's raw return value through to the dispatcher, which expects a `str`. Damage-spell handlers return an `int`; the dispatcher choked on `if "…" not in result`. Spells emit their flavour text via `char.messages` (the `apply_damage` / `_send_to_char` path), so `do_cast` now always returns a `"You cast <name>."` acknowledgment string.

### Added
- `tests/test_skills_spells_cast_listing.py::test_do_cast_magic_missile_dispatches_handler_and_damages_target` — end-to-end regression that places a caster + target in a `Room`, casts `'magic missile' Fido` through `do_cast`, and asserts the handler ran (HP dropped, mana consumed, no `"is not fully implemented yet"` / `"Spell cast failed"` string). This locks down all three latent paths above.

## [2.8.74]

### Fixed
- **`do_skills` / `do_spells` listing always returned "No skills found." / "No spells found."** (`mud/commands/misc_info.py:93-260`, ROM `src/skills.c:256-485`): both handlers iterated `getattr(mud.registry, "skill_table", {})`, a non-existent attribute that silently fell back to an empty dict. They also read the wrong skill fields (`spell_fun`, `skill_level`) and the wrong learned-percent source (`char.pcdata.learned` rather than `char.skills`). Rewritten to iterate `mud.skills.skill_registry.skills`, discriminate spells via `skill.type == "spell"`, look up class-level requirements via `skill.levels[ch_class]`, and read learned percentages from `char.skills` — matching the data source `do_practice` already uses successfully. Added ROM-faithful `[all] [max [min]]` argument parsing.
- **`do_cast <name>` reported "You don't know any spells of that name."** (`mud/commands/combat.py:704-791`, ROM `src/magic.c:299-360`): exact-match lookup against `char.skills` rejected ROM prefix abbreviations, and single-token argument parsing broke multi-word spells like `magic missile`. Rewritten to use `mud.utils.string_editor.first_arg` (ROM `one_argument` parity, single-quote aware) and `skill_registry.find_spell(...)` for prefix matching. Mana cost now follows ROM's `UMAX(skill.min_mana, 100 / (2 + level - skill.skill_level[class]))` formula, with the level+2 == required → 50 mana edge case.

### Added
- `tests/test_skills_spells_cast_listing.py` — 10 regression tests covering the three listing/cast paths against the canonical `data/skills.json` table, including NPC short-circuit, ROM "Arguments must be numerical or all." error, `cast 'magic missile' …` quoted multi-word parsing, and `cast magic …` prefix matching.

## [2.8.73]

### Added
- **`magic.c + magic2.c` subsystem closed at 100%**: `spell_pass_door()` parity (`mud/skills/handlers.py:5884` mirroring `src/magic.c:3864`) verified by new runtime-path integration coverage in `tests/integration/test_spell_affects_persistence.py::TestSpellPassDoorIntegration` — the affect persists through `game_tick()`, drops `AffectFlag.PASS_DOOR` on expiry, emits the ROM "You feel solid again." wear-off message exactly once, and a duplicate cast on an already-affected target is rejected with the ROM "already out of phase" message.

### Changed
- `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` P0-3 row updated from 98% → 100% (no remaining missing functions).

## [2.8.72]

### Fixed
- **`magic.c + magic2.c` affect persistence runtime parity** (`src/update.c:765-768`): `mud/affects/engine.py:tick_spell_effects` now mirrors ROM `char_update()` by applying the 20% per-point-pulse spell-strength fade (`level--` on `number_range(0, 4) == 0`) while durations decay through the real `game_tick()` path.

### Added
- **`magic.c + magic2.c` affect-persistence integration coverage**: `tests/integration/test_spell_affects_persistence.py` now proves three ROM runtime contracts through `game_tick()` — affects do not decay before `PULSE_TICK`, affect `level` can fade on the point pulse, and multi-entry spell affects emit exactly one wear-off message when they expire.

## [2.8.71]

### Fixed
- **`skills.c` game-loop integration parity** (`src/fight.c:192-196`, `src/fight.c:2952`, `src/update.c:update_handler`): descriptor-less actors no longer burn `wait`/`daze` every Python tick. `mud/game_loop.py:violence_tick` now mirrors ROM's split semantics — connected characters recover one pulse at a time, while descriptor-less actors recover in `PULSE_VIOLENCE` chunks on the combat cadence. The stale hardcoded timer burn was removed from `mud/combat/engine.py:multi_hit`.

### Added
- **`skills.c` runtime-path integration coverage**: `tests/integration/test_skills_integration.py` now proves a skill command (`bash`) enters combat and advances through `game_tick()` on the violence boundary, and locks wait-state recovery to ROM cadence. Companion unit expectations were updated to match the restored timer model.

## [2.8.70]

### Fixed
- **`PMOTE-003` — `do_pmote` and `do_smote` skip NPC viewers with `desc == NULL`** (`src/act_comm.c:1130`, `src/act_wiz.c:392-393`): ROM's pmote/smote viewer loops immediately `continue` when `vch->desc == NULL || vch == ch`, which excludes all NPC observers. Python's `mud/commands/imm_emote.py` had weakened that guard to `desc is None and not is_npc`, so NPCs incorrectly received both personalized pmote output and smote broadcasts. Fix: restore the ROM rule in both loops by skipping any non-self viewer whose `desc` is `None`. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_act_comm_gaps.py::TestPmoteGaps::test_pmote_003_npc_viewers_do_not_receive_pmote_or_smote`.

## [2.8.69]

### Fixed
- **`PMOTE-002` — `do_pmote` viewer broadcast routes actor `$N` through PERS** (`src/act_comm.c:1136,1188`): ROM sends pmote output to each eligible viewer via `act("$N $t", vch, ..., ch, TO_CHAR)`, which evaluates `PERS(ch, vch)` per recipient so an invisible actor renders as `"someone"` to viewers without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python's `mud/commands/imm_emote.py:do_pmote` previously hardcoded `f"{char_name} {substituted}"`, leaking the invisible actor's identity on both the matched-name and no-match branches. Fix: route the actor prefix through `mud.world.vision.pers(char, viewer)` per viewer. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_act_comm_gaps.py::TestPmoteGaps::test_pmote_002_invisible_actor_renders_as_someone_to_unaided_viewer`.

## [2.8.68]

### Changed
- Untrack `log/orphaned_helps.txt` (test artifact that drifted on every run) and add it to `log/.gitignore`. No code change.

### Docs
- **`PMOTE-001` — closed as ✅ FIXED in `docs/parity/ACT_COMM_C_AUDIT.md`** (`src/act_comm.c:1098-1192`): audit row was stale. `do_pmote` is fully implemented at `mud/commands/imm_emote.py:170` with NOEMOTE block, Moron guard, the letter-by-letter substitution loop mirroring ROM C `src/act_comm.c:1131-1175`, apostrophe/possessive handling (`"Bob's"` → `"your"`), and trailing-`s` absorption (`"Bobs"` → `"yous"`). Covered by 5 tests in `tests/integration/test_act_comm_gaps.py::TestPmoteGaps`. Two new sub-gaps filed during the re-check for follow-up: `PMOTE-002` (TO_CHAR `$N` prefix should route through PERS — invisible-actor leak parallel to EMOTE-001) and `PMOTE-003` (NPC viewers should be skipped via `desc is None`, not gated on `not is_npc` — same divergence in `do_smote`).

## [2.8.67]

### Fixed
- **`DAMMSG-001/002/003` — `dam_message` per-hit broadcasts route `$n` / `$N` through PERS per recipient** (`src/fight.c:2218-2228`): ROM's `dam_message` ends with three `act()` calls — `TO_NOTVICT`, `TO_CHAR`, `TO_VICT` — each evaluating `PERS(ch, looker)` and `PERS(victim, looker)` independently for every observer. Python's `dam_message` in `mud/combat/messages.py` previously returned `DamageMessages` containing three pre-rendered strings baked with `attacker.name` / `victim.name`, then the engine shipped them via `_broadcast_room` / `_push_message` without per-recipient PERS substitution — leaking both identities to every observer regardless of `can_see`. This is the highest-volume PERS leak in combat (fires on every melee swing and spell hit). Fix: (a) `dam_message` now returns templates with `{attacker}` / `{victim}` placeholders (ROM colour codes `{3...{x` doubled to survive `str.format()`); (b) new `render_for(template, attacker, victim, observer)` helper in `mud/combat/messages.py` substitutes both names through `pers()` per recipient; (c) `_dispatch_damage_messages` renamed to `_broadcast_damage_messages` (back-compat alias kept) and now iterates `room.people` for TO_NOTVICT, calling `render_for` per occupant — TO_CHAR uses `observer=attacker`, TO_VICT uses `observer=victim`. The `damage()` return value (consumed by `multi_hit`'s `attack_message` results) is also rendered for the attacker's view so scripted/test callers receive PERS-correct strings. Locked in by three new failing-first tests in `tests/integration/test_dam_message_pers.py` (one per direction); `tests/test_combat_messages.py` updated to call `render_for` on the returned templates.

## [2.8.66]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-014` — `_auto_sacrifice` TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/act_obj.c:1856`, dispatched from `src/fight.c:961-970`): ROM's `act("$n sacrifices $p to Mota.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS so an invisible attacker renders as `"someone"` to room observers without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python's `_auto_sacrifice` in `mud/combat/engine.py` previously pre-rendered the broadcast via `expand_placeholders(...)` baked into a single `_broadcast_room` string keyed on `attacker.name`, leaking the attacker's identity. Fix: route through `_broadcast_pos_change(attacker, "{name} sacrifices {corpse} to Mota.", corpse=corpse_name)`. Orphan `SimpleNamespace` import removed as a side effect (the only callsite was the broadcast we just rewrote). Locked in by `tests/integration/test_auto_sacrifice_pers.py::test_fight_014_auto_sacrifice_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_attacker`.

### Notes

- Python's `_auto_sacrifice` re-implements sacrifice logic inline rather than dispatching to `do_sacrifice` like ROM does at `src/fight.c:970`. That structural divergence (parallel implementation vs ROM dispatch) is tracked as FIGHT-015 (reserved) for a future session.

## [2.8.65]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-013` — WEAPON_SHOCKING TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:673-674`): ROM's `act("$n is struck by lightning from $p.", victim, wield, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS. Python's shocking branch in `process_weapon_special_attacks` previously baked `victim.name` into a fixed `_broadcast_room` string. Fix: route through `_broadcast_pos_change`. Closes the FIGHT-009..013 weapon-proc PERS sweep — all five weapon special-attack TO_ROOM broadcasts now ROM-faithful. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_weapon_proc_pers.py::TestWeaponProcBroadcastPers::test_fight_013_shocking_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

### Notes

- With FIGHT-009..013 closed the `mud/combat/engine.py` PERS surface is fully normalized for both position-change broadcasts (FIGHT-004..008) and weapon-proc broadcasts (FIGHT-009..013). Remaining PERS surfaces in combat: `dam_message` (ROM `src/fight.c:2035-2233`, the per-hit damage-tier broadcast surface — hundreds of `act()` lines), and `do_sacrifice` in `mud/combat/engine.py:956` (single `_broadcast_room` call with `expand_placeholders`-rendered fixed string).

## [2.8.64]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-012` — WEAPON_FROST TO_ROOM broadcast PERS + ROM-true wording** (`src/fight.c:663`): Two divergences. (a) PERS gap on `$n` — invisible victim leaks identity. (b) Wording — ROM `act("$p freezes $n.", ...)` puts the weapon first (e.g. `"the sword freezes Alice."`) but Python previously emitted `f"{victim.name} is frozen by {weapon_name}."` (subject/object inverted). Fix: `_broadcast_pos_change(victim, "{weapon} freezes {name}.", weapon=weapon_name)` — single change closes both sub-gaps. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_weapon_proc_pers.py::TestWeaponProcBroadcastPers::test_fight_012_frost_broadcast_uses_pers_and_rom_wording`.

## [2.8.63]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-011` — WEAPON_FLAMING TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:654`): ROM's `act("$n is burned by $p.", victim, wield, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS. Python's flaming branch in `process_weapon_special_attacks` previously baked `victim.name` into a fixed `_broadcast_room` string. Fix: route through `_broadcast_pos_change`. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_weapon_proc_pers.py::TestWeaponProcBroadcastPers::test_fight_011_flaming_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

## [2.8.62]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-010` — WEAPON_VAMPIRIC TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:643`): ROM's `act("$p draws life from $n.", victim, wield, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS. Python's vampiric branch in `process_weapon_special_attacks` previously baked `victim.name` into a fixed `_broadcast_room` string. Fix: route through `_broadcast_pos_change`. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_weapon_proc_pers.py::TestWeaponProcBroadcastPers::test_fight_010_vampiric_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

## [2.8.61]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-009` — WEAPON_POISON TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:614-615`): ROM's `act("$n is poisoned by the venom on $p.", victim, wield, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS. Python previously baked `victim.name` into a fixed `_broadcast_room` string. Fix: route through `_broadcast_pos_change`, now extended to accept `**extra` template kwargs (`{weapon}` for ROM `$p`). First commit in the FIGHT-009..013 weapon-proc PERS sweep. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_weapon_proc_pers.py::TestWeaponProcBroadcastPers::test_fight_009_poison_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

## [2.8.60]

### Fixed
- **`PROMPT-CMD-005` legacy-test hygiene**: two pre-existing legacy assertions missed in 2.8.54's PROMPT-CMD-005 rollout were asserting the pre-fix stored value (no trailing space). Updated `tests/integration/test_config_commands.py::test_prompt_custom` and `tests/test_player_auto_settings.py::TestPrompt::test_prompt_set_custom` to ROM-true stored values with trailing space, per AGENTS.md "ROM is the source of truth" rule. No production code change.

## [2.8.59]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-008` — POS_DEAD TO_CHAR self-message red colour + blank-line spacing** (`src/fight.c:861`): ROM's `send_to_char("{RYou have been KILLED!!{x\n\r\n\r", victim)` wraps the death notice in red colour codes and appends two `\n\r` pairs so a blank line follows the message. Python's `mud/combat/engine.py:_position_change_message` previously returned the bare `"You have been KILLED!!"` — no colour, no extra spacing. Fix: return `"{RYou have been KILLED!!{x\n"`. The protocol layer in `mud/net/protocol.py:send_to_char` auto-appends one `\r\n` to every message, so the embedded trailing `\n` plus the auto-append produces the same visual blank-line spacing ROM gets from its two `\n\r` pairs. Closes the FIGHT-004..008 position-change-broadcast sweep. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_invisibility_combat.py::TestPositionChangeBroadcastPers::test_fight_008_pos_dead_self_message_wraps_red_and_appends_blank_line`.

### Notes

- Closes the 2026-05-23 `fight.c` PERS sweep on the position-change broadcast surface (FIGHT-004..008 all ✅ FIXED in `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md`).
- Weapon-proc broadcasts at `mud/combat/engine.py:1496/1510/1531/1541/1551` have analogous PERS gaps but are deferred to a follow-up cluster (FIGHT-009..013 reserved).

## [2.8.58]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-007` — POS_DEAD TO_ROOM broadcast (PERS + red colour + two-bang wording)** (`src/fight.c:860`): ROM's `act("{R$n is DEAD!!{x", victim, 0, 0, TO_ROOM)` had three divergences vs Python's previous `f"{victim.name} is DEAD!!!"` baked broadcast: (a) `$n` must route through PERS per-listener so invisible victims render as `"someone"` for observers without `DETECT_INVIS`; (b) missing ROM red colour codes `{R...{x` that the ANSI translation layer consumes on websocket send; (c) wording typo — three exclamation marks instead of ROM's two. Fix: `mud/combat/engine.py:_position_change_message` DEAD branch now uses `_broadcast_pos_change(victim, "{{R{name} is DEAD!!{{x")`. Legacy assertion in `tests/test_combat.py` (×1) updated to ROM-exact form. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_invisibility_combat.py::TestPositionChangeBroadcastPers::test_fight_007_pos_dead_broadcast_uses_pers_and_red_colour_and_two_bangs`.

## [2.8.57]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-006` — POS_STUNNED TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:853-854`): ROM's `act("$n is stunned, but will probably recover.", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS. Python's STUNNED branch in `mud/combat/engine.py:_position_change_message` previously baked `victim.name` into a fixed `_broadcast_room` string. Fix: route through the `_broadcast_pos_change` helper. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_invisibility_combat.py::TestPositionChangeBroadcastPers::test_fight_006_pos_stunned_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

## [2.8.56]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-005` — POS_INCAP TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:845-846`): ROM's `act("$n is incapacitated and will slowly die, if not aided.", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through PERS. Python's INCAP branch in `mud/combat/engine.py:_position_change_message` previously baked `victim.name` into a fixed `_broadcast_room` string. Fix: route through the `_broadcast_pos_change` helper introduced in 2.8.55. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_invisibility_combat.py::TestPositionChangeBroadcastPers::test_fight_005_pos_incap_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

## [2.8.55]

### Fixed
- **`FIGHT-004` — POS_MORTAL TO_ROOM broadcast routes `$n` through PERS** (`src/fight.c:837-838`, `src/handler.c:2618`): ROM's `act("$n is mortally wounded, and will die soon, if not aided.", victim, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` renders `$n` per-listener through `PERS(victim, looker)`, so an invisible victim shows as `"someone"` to room observers without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python previously baked `victim.name` into a single fixed broadcast string via `_broadcast_room`, leaking the victim's identity to every recipient. Fix: new `_broadcast_pos_change` helper in `mud/combat/engine.py` iterates `room.people`, calls `mud.world.vision.pers(victim, listener)` per recipient, and dispatches through the same fire-and-forget websocket path as `broadcast_room`. Same channel-arc PERS fix pattern (SAY-002/EMOTE-001/TELL-003/SHOUT-003/YELL-001) applied to combat death messaging. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_invisibility_combat.py::TestPositionChangeBroadcastPers::test_fight_004_pos_mortal_broadcast_uses_pers_for_invisible_victim`.

### Notes

- First gap closed in the 2026-05-23 `fight.c` PERS sweep. FIGHT-005..008 (POS_INCAP / POS_STUNNED / POS_DEAD TO_ROOM and POS_DEAD TO_CHAR) stable-IDed in `docs/parity/FIGHT_C_AUDIT.md` and will land in follow-up commits using the new `_broadcast_pos_change` helper.

## [2.8.54]

### Fixed
- **`PROMPT-CMD-004` — `do_prompt` truncates custom template to 50 chars** (`src/act_info.c:943-944`): ROM caps the raw `argument` at 50 chars (`if (strlen(argument) > 50) argument[50] = '\0';`) before `strcpy`/`smash_tilde`/suffix-append. Python previously stored the full untruncated string. Fix: `mud/commands/auto_settings.py:do_prompt` slices `arg = arg[:50]` before smash_tilde. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_prompt_cmd_parity.py::test_prompt_cmd_004_truncates_template_to_50_chars`.
- **`PROMPT-CMD-005` — `do_prompt` appends trailing space unless template ends in `%c`** (`src/act_info.c:946-947`): ROM appends a literal space to every custom prompt template unless the (already smash_tilded) buf already ends with `%c` — `if (str_suffix("%c", buf)) strcat(buf, " ")`, and `str_suffix` (src/db.c:3784) returns TRUE when `"%c"` is *not* a suffix of buf. So prompts that don't end in a colour-code escape gain a trailing space; prompts that do (e.g. ANSI colour close) are left alone. Python previously skipped this normalization, so `prompt TAG>` stored `"TAG>"` instead of ROM's `"TAG> "`. Fix: `mud/commands/auto_settings.py:do_prompt` now applies `arg = arg + " "` when not `arg.endswith("%c")`, after smash_tilde and the 50-char truncation. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_player_prompt.py` (×4) and `tests/integration/test_prompt_rom_parity.py` (×1) updated to ROM-exact stored values. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_prompt_cmd_parity.py::test_prompt_cmd_005_appends_trailing_space_unless_pct_c_suffix`.

### Notes

- Closes the `do_prompt` warm-up shelf — PROMPT-CMD-001..005 now all ✅ FIXED in `docs/parity/ACT_INFO_C_AUDIT.md`.
- PROMPT-CMD-004 and PROMPT-CMD-005 committed jointly because the legacy test assertions in `tests/test_player_prompt.py` couple both fixes; separate commits would assert transient half-states.

## [2.8.53]

### Changed
- **`TELL-006` — closed as ✅ ANALYZED-INERT** (`src/act_comm.c:893,926,937`): ROM's `buf[0] = UPPER(buf[0])` on the buffered tell strings is provably a no-op in ROM C itself — the formatted string always begins with `'{'` (colour code `{k`), and `UPPER('{') == '{'` since `{` is not lowercase. Unlike TELL-004 (behaviorally masked by a separate code path), this transformation has no reachable behavior to mirror and no failing test can be written. Doc-only close; no code change. `docs/parity/ACT_COMM_C_AUDIT.md` row flipped from 🔄 OPEN to ✅ ANALYZED. With this, the entire `do_tell` gap row (TELL-001..006) is closed.

## [2.8.52]

### Fixed
- **`YELL-001` — `do_yell` TO_VICT `$n` routes through PERS for invisible-yeller protection** (`src/act_comm.c:1059`, `src/handler.c:2618`): ROM's `act("$n yells '$t'", ..., TO_VICT)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through `PERS(ch, victim)`. So an invisible yeller renders as `"someone"` to listeners without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python's `do_yell` already iterates per-listener (area-wide loop over `character_registry` with area filter) but hardcoded `char.name` into the rendered string. Fix: `mud/commands/communication.py:do_yell` now substitutes `mud.world.vision.pers(char, victim)` for the yeller's name inside its existing per-listener loop. Closes the channel-message arc (say / tell / emote / shout / yell all now route through PERS). Locked in by `tests/integration/test_shout_yell_parity.py::test_yell_001_invisible_yeller_renders_as_someone_to_listener`.

### Notes

- Completes the 2026-05-22/23 act_comm.c channel re-audit arc: `do_say` (SAY-001..004), `do_emote` (EMOTE-001/002), `do_tell` (TELL-001..005), `do_shout` (SHOUT-001..003), `do_yell` (YELL-001). All five channel commands now route `$n` through `pers()` and emit ROM-exact wording / colour codes. PMOTE-001 remains as the only open ROM `do_pmote` greenfield port; TELL-006 deferred (MINOR cosmetic).
- Full suite at `4629 passed, 4 skipped` (+1 vs 2.8.51; zero regressions).

## [2.8.51]

### Fixed
- **`SHOUT-003` — `do_shout` TO_VICT `$n` routes through PERS for invisible-shouter protection** (`src/act_comm.c:836`, `src/handler.c:2618`): ROM's `act("$n shouts '$t'", ...)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through `PERS(ch, victim)`. So an invisible shouter renders as `"someone"` to listeners without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python previously broadcast one fixed message string via `broadcast_global(message, channel="shout", exclude=char, should_send=_should_receive)`, leaking the invisible shouter's identity to every recipient. Fix: replaced `broadcast_global` in `mud/commands/communication.py:do_shout` with a per-listener loop over `character_registry` (mirroring ROM's `descriptor_list` iteration at `src/act_comm.c:825-838`) that filters by `SHOUTSOFF` / `QUIET` / muted_channels and renders `mud.world.vision.pers(char, victim)` per recipient. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_shout_yell_parity.py::test_shout_003_invisible_shouter_renders_as_someone_to_listener`.

### Notes

- Third of three `do_shout` gaps from the 2026-05-23 re-audit. `do_shout` is now complete. YELL-001 (same PERS pattern in `do_yell`) remains open and is the last item in the channel-message arc.
- Full suite at `4628 passed, 4 skipped, 1 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.50; zero regressions despite the per-listener broadcast refactor).

## [2.8.50]

### Fixed
- **`SHOUT-002` — `do_shout` TO_VICT wording drops the comma** (`src/act_comm.c:836`): ROM emits `act("$n shouts '$t'", ...)` — no comma between `shouts` and the open quote. Python broadcast `"{char.name} shouts, '{cleaned}'"` with an extra comma. Fix: drop the comma in the broadcast message string. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_communication.py` (×2) updated. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_shout_yell_parity.py::test_shout_002_to_vict_wording_drops_comma`.

### Notes

- Second of three `do_shout` gaps. SHOUT-003 (PERS for shouter) and YELL-001 (PERS for yeller) remain open.
- Full suite at `4627 passed, 4 skipped, 2 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.49; zero regressions).

## [2.8.49]

### Fixed
- **`SHOUT-001` — `do_shout` TO_CHAR wording drops the comma** (`src/act_comm.c:824`): ROM emits `act("You shout '$T'", ...)` — no comma between `shout` and the open quote. Python previously returned `"You shout, '{cleaned}'"` with an extra comma. Fix: drop the comma in `mud/commands/communication.py:do_shout` return. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_communication.py` (×2) were baked to the buggy comma form and have been updated to the ROM-exact wording. Surfaced by a 2026-05-23 `do_shout` re-audit that found the prior "100% VERIFIED" claim incorrect (same audit-doc inflation that hit `do_say` / `do_emote` / `do_tell` this run). Locked in by `tests/integration/test_shout_yell_parity.py::test_shout_001_to_char_wording_drops_comma`.

### Notes

- First of three `do_shout` gaps from the 2026-05-23 re-audit. SHOUT-002 (TO_VICT wording), SHOUT-003 (PERS for shouter), plus YELL-001 (PERS for yeller — `do_yell` already gets wording right) all stable-IDed and queued.
- Full suite at `4626 passed, 4 skipped, 3 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.48; zero regressions).

## [2.8.48]

### Fixed
- **`TELL-005` — `do_tell` wraps both lines with ROM `{k...{K...{k...{x` charcoal colour codes** (`src/act_comm.c:941-942`): ROM frames the tell channel in charcoal/black (`{k`), switches to bright/highlighted-charcoal (`{K`) for the message body, returns to `{k` for the closing quote, and resets with `{x`. The ANSI translation layer at `mud/net/ansi.py` consumes those tokens on websocket send. Python previously emitted no codes, so the tell channel rendered in the player's default terminal colour and the framing-vs-body contrast ROM relies on was lost. Fix: `mud/commands/communication.py:do_tell` return and `_handle_buffered_tell` formatted string now wrap with the ROM colour sequence. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_communication.py` (×5) and `tests/integration/test_communication_enhancement.py` were baked to the codeless plain-text form (per AGENTS.md — tests asserting Python behavior contradicting ROM are bugs in the **test**, not the implementation) and have been updated to the ROM-exact wording. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_tell_parity.py::test_tell_005_to_char_wraps_rom_color_codes` and `::test_tell_005_to_vict_wraps_rom_color_codes`.

### Notes

- Fifth of six TELL-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_tell` re-audit. The audit's main cluster (TELL-001/002/003/004/005) is now closed. TELL-006 (uppercase first char of buffered tells — MINOR cosmetic) remains intentionally deferred and stable-IDed in `docs/parity/ACT_COMM_C_AUDIT.md`.
- Full suite at `4625 passed, 4 skipped` (+2 vs 2.8.47 baseline 4623/4; zero regressions).

## [2.8.47]

### Fixed
- **`TELL-004` — `do_tell` TO_CHAR `$N` routes through PERS for code-structure parity** (`src/act_comm.c:941`, `src/handler.c:2618`): ROM's `act("You tell $N '$t'", ...)` substitutes `$N` (capital) through `PERS(victim, ch)`. In practice this is masked by `get_char_world`'s `can_see` filtering during name lookup — an invisible target returns `"They aren't here."` before PERS would ever evaluate (same in ROM and Python). Fix is defensive code-parity: `mud/commands/communication.py:do_tell` return now substitutes `mud.world.vision.pers(target, char)` for the target name so the macro structure matches ROM regardless of future lookup-path changes. Test: `tests/integration/test_tell_parity.py::test_tell_004_to_char_uses_pers_for_target_name` pins the visible-target code path; the unreachable `"someone"` branch is exercised by sibling PERS tests (SAY-002, EMOTE-001, TELL-003).

### Notes

- Fourth of six TELL-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_tell` re-audit. TELL-005 (charcoal colour codes) remains open. TELL-006 deferred (MINOR).
- Full suite at `4623 passed, 4 skipped, 2 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.46; zero regressions).

## [2.8.46]

### Fixed
- **`TELL-003` — `do_tell` TO_VICT `$n` routes through PERS for invisible-sender protection** (`src/act_comm.c:942`, `src/handler.c:2618`): ROM's `act_new("$n tells you '$t'", ...)` substitutes `$n` per-target through `PERS(ch, victim)`, so an invisible sender renders as `"someone"` to a target without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python's `_handle_buffered_tell` hardcoded `sender.name`, leaking the invisible sender's identity (same pattern as pre-fix `do_say` / `do_emote`). Fix: substitute `mud.world.vision.pers(sender, target)` for the sender's name in the formatted string. Also applies to the buffered tell paths (linkdead / AFK / note-writing) since ROM's `sprintf(..., PERS(ch, victim), ...)` at `src/act_comm.c:891`/`924`/`935` wraps the same PERS call. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_tell_parity.py::test_tell_003_invisible_sender_renders_as_someone_to_target`.

### Notes

- Third of six TELL-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_tell` re-audit. TELL-004 (PERS for target to sender) and TELL-005 (charcoal colour codes) remain open. TELL-006 deferred (MINOR).
- Full suite at `4622 passed, 4 skipped, 3 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.45; zero regressions).

## [2.8.45]

### Fixed
- **`TELL-002` — `do_tell` TO_VICT wording drops the comma** (`src/act_comm.c:942`): ROM emits `act_new("$n tells you '$t'", ...)` — no comma between `you` and the open quote. Python's `_handle_buffered_tell` previously formatted `"{sender.name} tells you, '{message}'"` with an extra comma. Fix: drop the comma in `mud/commands/communication.py:_handle_buffered_tell` formatted string. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_communication.py` (×4) were baked to the buggy comma form and have been updated to the ROM-exact wording. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_tell_parity.py::test_tell_002_to_vict_wording_drops_comma`.

### Notes

- Second of six TELL-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_tell` re-audit. TELL-003 (PERS for sender to victim), TELL-004 (PERS for target to sender), TELL-005 (charcoal colour codes) remain open. TELL-006 deferred (MINOR).
- Full suite at `4621 passed, 4 skipped, 4 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.44; zero regressions).

## [2.8.44]

### Fixed
- **`TELL-001` — `do_tell` TO_CHAR wording drops the comma** (`src/act_comm.c:941`): ROM emits `act("You tell $N '$t'", ...)` — no comma between target name and the open quote. Python previously returned `"You tell {target.name}, '{message}'"` with an extra comma. Fix: drop the comma in `mud/commands/communication.py:do_tell` return. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_communication.py` (×2) and `tests/integration/test_communication_enhancement.py` were baked to the buggy comma form and have been updated to the ROM-exact wording. Surfaced by a 2026-05-22 `do_tell` re-audit that found the prior "100% VERIFIED" claim incorrect (same audit-doc inflation that hit `do_say` and `do_emote` this session). Locked in by `tests/integration/test_tell_parity.py::test_tell_001_to_char_wording_drops_comma`.

### Notes

- First of six TELL-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_tell` re-audit. TELL-002 (TO_VICT wording comma), TELL-003 (PERS for sender to victim), TELL-004 (PERS for target to sender), TELL-005 (charcoal colour codes) remain open and will close in sequence. TELL-006 (uppercase first char of buffered tells — MINOR cosmetic) is intentionally deferred.
- Full suite at `4620 passed, 4 skipped, 5 deselected` (+1 vs 2.8.43 baseline 4619/4; deselected = the still-open TELL gaps; zero regressions).

## [2.8.43]

### Fixed
- **`EMOTE-002` — `do_emote` TO_CHAR `$n` renders as "You", not the actor's own name** (`src/act_comm.c:1092`): ROM's `act("$n $T", ..., TO_CHAR)` substitutes `$n` to `"You"` on the self branch — the actor reads `"You smiles happily"`, not `"Alice smiles happily"`. Python previously returned `f"{char.name} {args}"` so the actor saw their own name as the emote subject. Fix: `mud/commands/communication.py:do_emote` now returns `f"You {args}"`. Legacy `tests/integration/test_communication_enhancement.py::test_emote_broadcasts_custom_action` was baked to the buggy form (per AGENTS.md — tests asserting Python behavior contradicting ROM are bugs in the **test**, not the implementation) and has been updated to the ROM-exact wording. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_emote_parity.py::test_emote_002_self_message_renders_you_not_actor_name`.

### Notes

- Second of three gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_emote` re-audit. PMOTE-001 (`do_pmote` not implemented in Python) remains open as a missing-function gap, tracked for a future session.
- Full suite at `4619 passed, 4 skipped` (+1 vs 2.8.42 baseline 4618/4; zero regressions).

## [2.8.42]

### Fixed
- **`EMOTE-001` — `do_emote` PERS substitution: invisible emoter renders as `"someone"`** (`src/act_comm.c:1091`, `src/handler.c:2618-2664`): ROM's `act("$n $T", ..., TO_ROOM)` substitutes `$n` per-listener through `PERS()` so an invisible emoter renders as `"someone"` to listeners without `DETECT_INVIS`. Python previously hardcoded `char.name` into one TO_ROOM message and broadcast it to everyone in the room, leaking the invisible emoter's identity exactly like the pre-fix `do_say` (SAY-002). Fix: refactored `mud/commands/communication.py:do_emote` to render TO_ROOM per-listener using `mud.world.vision.pers(char, listener)` (the helper added in 2.8.41 for SAY-002). Tests: `tests/integration/test_emote_parity.py::test_emote_001_invisible_emoter_renders_as_someone_to_unaided_listener` and `::test_emote_001_visible_emoter_renders_real_name_to_listener`.

- First of three gaps from the 2026-05-22 `do_emote` re-audit. EMOTE-002 (TO_CHAR `$n` → "You" instead of actor's own name) and PMOTE-001 (`do_pmote` not implemented in Python) remain open.
- Full suite at `4618 passed, 4 skipped` (+2 vs 2.8.41 baseline 4616/4; zero regressions despite the per-listener broadcast refactor).

## [2.8.41]

### Added
- **`mud.world.vision.pers(target, observer)`** mirroring ROM's `PERS()` macro (`src/comm.c` via `#define` and `src/handler.c:2618-2664 can_see`). Returns `"someone"` if `observer` cannot see `target`, otherwise the target's NPC `short_descr` or PC `name`. No aura prefixes (that's `act_info show_char_to_char_0`) and no self-handling (callers route TO_CHAR vs TO_ROOM separately).

### Fixed
- **`SAY-002` — `do_say` PERS substitution: invisible/hidden speakers appear as `"someone"`** (`src/act_comm.c:776`, `src/handler.c:2618-2664`): ROM's `act()` substitutes `$n` through `PERS(ch, looker)`, which gates on `can_see(looker, ch)`. So when an invisible speaker says something, listeners without `DETECT_INVIS` see `"someone says '<msg>'"`, not the speaker's real name. Python previously built one TO_ROOM message string with `char.name` hardcoded and broadcast it to everyone in the room, leaking invisible/hidden PC identities. Fix: added `pers()` helper in `mud/world/vision.py` (uses existing `can_see_character`), then refactored `do_say` to render the TO_ROOM string per-listener with `pers(speaker, listener)` substituted for `$n`. Closes the four-gap `do_say` re-audit cluster opened on 2026-05-22. Tests: `tests/integration/test_say_parity.py::test_say_002_invisible_speaker_renders_as_someone_to_unaided_listener` and `::test_say_002_invisible_speaker_seen_by_detect_invis_listener`.

### Notes

- Fourth and final SAY-NNN gap from the 2026-05-22 `act_comm.c` re-audit. `do_say` is now ✅ 100% re-audited.
- Analogous CRITICAL gaps almost certainly exist in `do_tell` / `do_shout` / `do_yell` / `do_emote` / `do_pose` / `do_pmote` — those audits are now unblocked (the helper exists). Tracked as next-session candidates in `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md`.
- Full suite at `4616 passed, 4 skipped` (+2 vs 2.8.40 baseline 4614/4; zero regressions despite the per-listener broadcast refactor).

## [2.8.40]

### Fixed
- **`SAY-003` — `do_say` wraps output with ROM colour codes (`{6...{7$T{6'{x`)** (`src/act_comm.c:776-777`): ROM frames the say channel in cyan/green (`{6`), switches to white (`{7`) for the message body, returns to `{6` for the closing quote, and resets with `{x`. The ANSI translation layer at `mud/net/ansi.py` consumes those tokens on websocket send. Python previously emitted no codes, so the say channel rendered in the player's default terminal colour and the framing-vs-body contrast ROM relies on was lost. Fix: `mud/commands/communication.py:do_say` now wraps both TO_CHAR and TO_ROOM strings with the ROM colour sequence. Legacy assertions in `tests/test_commands.py`, `tests/test_command_abbrev.py`, and `tests/integration/test_communication_enhancement.py` were baked to the codeless plain-text form (per AGENTS.md, tests asserting Python behavior contradicting ROM are bugs in the **test**, not the implementation) and have been updated. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_say_parity.py::test_say_003_to_char_wraps_rom_color_codes` and `::test_say_003_to_room_wraps_rom_color_codes`.

### Notes

- Third of four SAY-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `act_comm.c` re-audit. SAY-002 (`$n` PERS for invisible speakers) remains open — requires building a Python `pers()` helper that mirrors ROM's `PERS()` macro.
- Full suite at `4614 passed, 4 skipped` (+2 vs 2.8.39 baseline 4612/4; zero regressions).

## [2.8.39]

### Fixed
- **`SAY-004` — `do_say` delivers TO_ROOM broadcast exactly once (INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY)** (`src/act_comm.c:776`): ROM's `act(..., TO_ROOM)` iterates `ch->in_room->people` and delivers to each target exactly once. Python called BOTH `char.room.broadcast(message, exclude=char)` AND `broadcast_room(char.room, message, exclude=char)`. The two helpers do identical work — iterate `room.people`, fire-and-forget websocket send, append to `char.messages` — so every `say` was delivered twice. Players received "<name> says 'hi'" twice; transcripts and message queues both diverged. Fix: dropped the redundant `broadcast_room` call in `mud/commands/communication.py:do_say`, keeping only `char.room.broadcast`. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_say_parity.py::test_say_004_listener_receives_broadcast_exactly_once`.

### Notes

- Second of four SAY-NNN gaps from the 2026-05-22 `act_comm.c` re-audit. SAY-002 (`$n` PERS for invisible speakers) and SAY-003 (ROM colour codes) remain open.
- Full suite at `4612 passed, 4 skipped` (+1 vs 2.8.38 baseline 4611/4; zero regressions).

## [2.8.38]

### Fixed
- **`SAY-001` — `do_say` wording matches ROM (`says '$T'` / `You say '$T'` — no comma)** (`src/act_comm.c:776-777`): ROM emits `act("$n says '$T'", ...)` and `act("You say '$T'", ...)`. Python emitted `"says, '..'"` and `"You say, '..'"` with a comma the player did not type. Surfaced by a 2026-05-22 re-audit of `act_comm.c` that found the previous "100% VERIFIED" claim was incorrect. Fix: `mud/commands/communication.py:do_say` now produces the ROM-exact wording. Legacy `tests/test_commands.py`, `tests/test_command_abbrev.py`, `tests/integration/test_communication_enhancement.py` assertions were baked to the buggy comma form (per AGENTS.md — tests that assert Python behavior contradicting ROM are bugs in the **test**, not the implementation) and have been updated to the ROM-exact wording. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_say_parity.py::test_say_001_room_broadcast_drops_comma` and `test_say_001_to_char_drops_comma`.

### Notes

- Three additional `do_say` gaps surfaced by the re-audit are stable-IDed in `docs/parity/ACT_COMM_C_AUDIT.md` for sequential closure: SAY-002 (`$n` PERS substitution for invisible speakers), SAY-003 (ROM colour codes), SAY-004 (double-delivery via `room.broadcast` + `broadcast_room` — INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY violation).
- Full suite at `4611 passed, 4 skipped` (+2 vs 2.8.37 baseline 4609/4; zero regressions).

## [2.8.37]

### Fixed
- **`PROMPT-CMD-003` — `do_prompt` runs `smash_tilde` on custom template before storing** (`src/act_info.c:945`, `src/db.c:3663-3672`): ROM calls `smash_tilde(buf)` before `ch->prompt = str_dup(buf)`, replacing every `~` with `-` so the stored template cannot corrupt the player file on save (ROM treats `~` as the end-of-string marker on disk). Python's `do_prompt` previously stored the raw argument including any tildes the player typed. Fix: `mud/commands/auto_settings.py:do_prompt` now calls `mud.utils.text.smash_tilde` on the custom-template branch before assigning `char.prompt`. Locked in by `tests/integration/test_prompt_cmd_parity.py::test_prompt_cmd_003_smash_tilde_on_custom_template`.

### Notes

- Closes the PROMPT-CMD cluster opened by 2.8.35's NANNY-SAVELOAD-002 probe (PROMPT-CMD-001/002 landed in 2.8.36).
- Two ROM-divergence corners remain on `do_prompt` but are now stable-IDed for future hardening: PROMPT-CMD-004 (50-char truncation), PROMPT-CMD-005 (`%c`-suffix → append trailing space). Both are corner cases — no behavioral impact for typical players — and tracked in `docs/parity/ACT_INFO_C_AUDIT.md`.
- Full suite at `4609 passed, 4 skipped` (+1 vs 2.8.36 baseline 4608/4; zero regressions).

## [2.8.36]

### Fixed
- **`PROMPT-CMD-001` — `do_prompt` preserves trailing whitespace in custom templates** (`src/act_info.c:944`): the dispatcher (`mud/commands/dispatcher.py:process_command`) used `core = trimmed.rstrip()` which stripped visible trailing whitespace from every command before reaching its handler. ROM `src/interp.c:interpret` only strips line-ending whitespace, leaving visible trailing whitespace intact. Fix: dispatcher now uses `core = trimmed.rstrip("\r\n")` and computes log-line trailing whitespace from `trimmed.rstrip()` separately so the existing per-command log convention (`tests/test_logging_admin.py::test_logging_logs_alias_expansion`) is preserved. Also removed `arg = args.strip()` in `mud/commands/auto_settings.py:do_prompt` so the handler now uses the raw arg (matching ROM's raw `argument` usage at `src/act_info.c:944`). Now `prompt MYTAG> ` correctly stores `"MYTAG> "` and `bust_a_prompt` renders the trailing space.
- **`PROMPT-CMD-002` — `do_prompt` success reply echoes the stored template** (`src/act_info.c:953-954`): Python previously emitted the truncated `"Prompt set."`; ROM emits `"Prompt set to %s\n\r"` with the stored template. Fixed both the `"all"` branch and the custom-template branch in `mud/commands/auto_settings.py:do_prompt`. Existing helper tests (`tests/test_player_prompt.py`) and the live-websocket round-trip in `tests/integration/test_nanny_saveload_runtime_path.py` updated to the ROM-exact wording.

### Notes

- New enforcement tests in `tests/integration/test_prompt_cmd_parity.py` lock in both gaps on the live websocket path.
- Full suite at `4608 passed, 4 skipped` (+2 vs 2.8.35 baseline 4606/4; zero regressions). Surfaced and fixed in a single session after being flagged in 2.8.35's NANNY-SAVELOAD-002 probe.

## [2.8.35]

### Changed
- **`NANNY-SAVELOAD-001` — wimpy round-trips through reconnect** (`src/act_info.c:2800-2830`, `src/save.c:fwrite_char/fread_char`, `src/act_info.c:1548-1549`): added `tests/integration/test_nanny_saveload_runtime_path.py::test_nanny_saveload_001_wimpy_round_trips_through_reconnect` exercising `wimpy <n>` mid-session, then asserting the value comes back via `score` on the first command after reconnect. Verified the live runtime path; no implementation drift found.
- **`NANNY-SAVELOAD-002` — custom prompt template round-trips through reconnect** (`src/act_info.c:919-955`, `src/comm.c:1420-1595`): added `tests/integration/test_nanny_saveload_runtime_path.py::test_nanny_saveload_002_prompt_template_round_trips_through_reconnect` exercising `prompt <template>` mid-session, then asserting the first in-game prompt after reconnect renders the saved template (no ROM-default `<Nhp Nm Nmv>` fallback). Verified the live runtime path; the persistence layer round-trip is intact. Probe also surfaced two **separate** `do_prompt` command-side parity gaps (not save→reload bugs): (a) the dispatcher strips trailing whitespace from `prompt <template>` args before `do_prompt` sees them, so a template with a trailing space loses it; (b) the success reply is the truncated `"Prompt set."` instead of ROM's `"Prompt set to <template>\n\r"` which echoes the stored template. Both captured as follow-ups in `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md`.
- **`NANNY-SAVELOAD-003` — per-character aliases round-trip through reconnect** (`src/alias.c:102-220`, `src/save.c:fwrite_char/fread_char`): added `tests/integration/test_nanny_saveload_runtime_path.py::test_nanny_saveload_003_alias_round_trips_through_reconnect` exercising `alias k kill` mid-session, then asserting the alias listing on the first command after reconnect re-renders the saved entry with ROM listing format `"    k:  kill"`. Verified the live runtime path through the DB JSON column; no implementation drift found.

### Notes

- Full suite at `4606 passed, 4 skipped` (+3 vs 2.8.34 baseline 4603/4; zero regressions).
- Plan Task 4 (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-21-parity-trust-rebuild-reaudit.md`) — save → reload → retained-state runtime-path bullet — is now complete. Remaining trust-rebuild work shifts to Plan Task 5 (re-audit other high-risk user-visible command families).

## [2.8.34]

### Fixed
- **`INV-009` REGISTRY-DISCONNECT-CLEANUP** (new cross-file invariant): `character_registry` was accumulating duplicate `Character` entries per player name in two places:
  - **In-session promote-from-bare-row duplication.** The level=0 bare-row Character loaded at `_select_character` (during the nanny name/password phase) was appended to `character_registry` and never replaced. After creation finalised, a fresh level=1 Character was loaded via `load_character` and appended on top, leaving both in the registry. `next((c for c in character_registry if c.name == X), None)` could return the stale level=0 entry (e.g. `hit=20`) while the live session ran against the level=1 entry (`hit=100`).
  - **Cross-session leak on clean disconnect.** The websocket and telnet disconnect `finally` blocks already saved the character, removed them from their room, and released the account — but never removed them from `character_registry`. Each disconnect-then-reconnect cycle added a new entry without removing the old one.
- **Fix (`mud/account/account_manager.py:load_character`)**: drop any prior `character_registry` entry with the same name before appending the freshly-loaded one (dedup-by-name on append).
- **Fix (`mud/net/connection.py` websocket + telnet disconnect cleanup)**: remove the Character from `character_registry` in the `if char: if not forced_disconnect:` block, matching the `save + char_from_room + release_account` quit semantics already present. Forced disconnects (descriptor takeover) skip removal — `_disconnect_session` transfers the live Character to the new descriptor.
- **Test**: `tests/integration/test_inv009_registry_disconnect_cleanup.py::test_inv009_registry_has_single_entry_after_disconnect_and_reconnect` reproduces both cases on the live websocket path and asserts: (a) zero `Regista` entries after a clean disconnect, (b) exactly one `Regista` entry while a reconnected session is active.
- **Tracker**: new INV-009 row in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`.

### Notes

- Full suite at `4603 passed, 4 skipped` (+1 vs 2.8.33 baseline 4602/4; zero regressions).
- Discovered during NANNY-RECONNECT-003 debugging in 2.8.33 (see SESSION_SUMMARY_2026-05-22_NANNY_RECONNECT_RUNTIME_PATH_PARITY.md "follow-ups").

## [2.8.33]

### Changed
- **`NANNY-RECONNECT-001` — `score` after reconnect transcript parity** (`src/act_info.c:1477-1507`, `src/nanny.c:760`): added a websocket-runtime-path regression in `tests/test_websocket_server.py::test_websocket_reconnect_score_matches_rom_act_info_lines` that asserts ROM-exact title (`"You are <name> the Apprentice of Magic, level 1, ..."`), race/sex/class line (`"Race: elf  Sex: male  Class: mage"`), and hit/mana/move at full after `reset_char` on login. Verified the live runtime path; no implementation drift found.
- **`NANNY-RECONNECT-002` — `look` after reconnect matches live room registry** (`src/act_info.c:1037-1116`): added `tests/test_websocket_server.py::test_websocket_reconnect_look_matches_room_registry_not_cached_snapshot` which reconnects an elf mage, snapshots the live `character_registry` entry's `room.name` and description, then asserts the `look` transcript on the **first command after reconnect** contains both — guarding against stale pre-disconnect cached snapshots. Verified the live runtime path; no implementation drift found.
- **`NANNY-RECONNECT-003` — first in-game prompt after reconnect reflects loaded resources** (`src/comm.c:1437-1443`, `src/nanny.c:760`): added `tests/test_websocket_server.py::test_websocket_reconnect_initial_prompt_reflects_loaded_resources` which captures the first post-MOTD prompt on the live websocket, then sends `score` on the same session and asserts the ROM `<Nhp Nm Nmv>` token values equal what `score` reports (self-consistent), and that `hit == max_hit` after `reset_char` on login. Verified the live runtime path; no implementation drift found.

### Notes

- Full suite at `4602 passed, 4 skipped` (+3 vs prior baseline 4599/4; zero regressions).
- During NANNY-RECONNECT-003 debugging, a `character_registry` reconnect-duplication oddity surfaced (stale pre-disconnect Character returned by name lookup). Recorded as a follow-up in `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` for a dedicated future slice.

## [2.8.32]

### Fixed
- **`nanny.c` happy-path new-character creation prompts**: `mud/net/connection.py` now emits ROM-exact `"New character."`, `"Give me a password for <Name>:"`, `"Please retype password:"`, and ROM race/sex/class/weapon prompt wording on the live runtime path. Removed the non-ROM `"Creating new character 'X'."` line and the non-ROM stat-reroll and hometown prompts (ROM `nanny.c:476-478` derives `perm_stat` from `pc_race_table[race].stats[i]` and has no such prompts).
- **`nanny.c` pre-login greeting parser**: the greeting no longer leaks the embedded MOTD block before `Name:`.
- **`NANNY-RETRY-001` — race invalid wording** (`src/nanny.c:460-471`): `_prompt_for_race` now sends `"That is not a valid race."` (was `"That's"`); race listing prefix is `"The following races are available:\n\r  "` to match ROM telnet line endings.
- **`NANNY-RETRY-002` — race "help" branch wording** (`src/nanny.c:444-453`): verified ROM-exact; regression test added.
- **`NANNY-RETRY-003` — class invalid wording** (`src/nanny.c:538-539`): `_prompt_for_class` now sends `"That's not a class."` (was `"That's not a valid class."`) and switches the retry prompt to `"What IS your class? "`.
- **`NANNY-RETRY-004` — customize Y/N retry** (`src/nanny.c:626-628`): `_prompt_customization_choice` now sends `"Please answer (Y/N)? "` on invalid entry (was the generic `"Please answer Y or N."`). `_prompt_yes_no` gained an optional `retry_message` kwarg so other Y/N callsites keep their existing wording.
- **`NANNY-RETRY-005` / `NANNY-RETRY-006` — weapon prompt CRLF** (`src/nanny.c:611-624`, `:638-649`): the weapon-pick prompt and its invalid-entry retry now use ROM `\n\r` line endings before `"Your choice? "` (were bare `\n`).

### Changed
- **Stricter creation transcript coverage**: `tests/integration/test_nanny_login_parity.py` adds six transcript-parity tests (`NANNY-RETRY-001..006`); full suite now at `4599 passed, 4 skipped` (+6 from prior baseline 4593/4, zero regressions).

## [2.8.31]

### Fixed
- **`nanny.c` trust-rebuild: `CON_READ_MOTD` now emits the ROM welcome line**: `mud/net/connection.py` now sends `Welcome to ROM 2.4.  Please don't feed the mobiles!` at the moment a normal login actually enters the game, matching the ROM branch instead of skipping straight to MOTD/help/look output.
- **Forced reconnects no longer run the normal login tail**: duplicate-session takeover reconnects now skip the normal welcome/look/board path and only emit the ROM reconnect-side output, which restores parity with `check_reconnect(..., TRUE)` and keeps telnet reconnect sequencing stable.

### Changed
- **Stricter reconnect/login runtime coverage**: `tests/test_websocket_server.py` now asserts the ROM welcome line on first entry, and the full suite recertifies clean with the reconnect split in place (`4593 passed, 4 skipped`).

## [2.8.30]

### Fixed
- **`save.c` trust-rebuild: reconnect now preserves the school outfit**: `mud/models/character.py` now restores equipped items from DB-canonical `equipment_state` without silently dropping them on load, and recomputes carry totals after inventory/equipment restore so the first `score` after reconnect matches the first `score` after character creation.
- **`nanny.c` trust-rebuild: login now emits the ROM board summary**: `mud/net/connection.py` now mirrors the tail of `CON_READ_MOTD` by sending a blank line and `board` output after the initial room `look` on both connection paths.

### Changed
- **Stricter runtime-path persistence coverage**: `tests/test_websocket_server.py` now asserts both reconnect outfit persistence and post-login board summary output on the real WebSocket path, and `tests/integration/test_inv008_persistence_coherence.py` now locks equipment/carry-state save-load round trips directly.

## [2.8.29]

### Fixed
- **`nanny.c` trust-rebuild: returning level-1 players no longer replay first-login outfit flow**: `mud/net/connection.py` now treats the persisted `newbie_help_seen` flag as the durable first-login marker, so reconnecting or relogging level-1 characters no longer get re-equipped by Mota or reclassified as brand-new.

### Changed
- **Stricter runtime-path login coverage**: `tests/test_websocket_server.py` now asserts that a real WebSocket reconnect does not replay the one-time school outfit path, and `tests/test_connection_motd.py` now locks the `_is_new_player()` helper contract directly.

## [2.8.28]

### Fixed
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `do_look` dark-room and container-detail parity**: `mud/world/look.py` now mirrors ROM dark-room output more closely by appending raw visible character lines without a Python-only `Characters:` label, and `look in` now uses the ROM drink-container wording with liquid color plus the correct `CONT_CLOSED` bit for closed containers.
- **`check_blind()` / `do_look` blind-gate parity**: `mud/rom_api.py` now rejects `AFF_BLIND` correctly, and `mud/world/look.py` now returns the ROM blind message `"You can't see a thing!"` instead of falling through to normal room output.

### Changed
- **Stricter `do_look` regression coverage**: `tests/integration/test_do_look_command.py` now includes exact ROM-style assertions for dark-room visible occupants, drink-container liquid wording, closed-container gating, and blindness; `tests/test_rom_api.py` now locks the blind helper contract directly.

## [2.8.27]

### Fixed
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `do_look` autoexit parity**: `mud/world/look.py` no longer emits a manual exits line on every room look; exits now appear only through the ROM `PLR_AUTOEXIT` branch.
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `do_look` room rendering parity**: room contents and visible occupants are now appended as raw lines instead of Python-only `Objects:` / `Characters:` labels, matching ROM `show_list_to_char` / `show_char_to_char` behavior more closely.

### Changed
- **Direct `do_look` regression coverage**: added ROM-exact room-look tests for autoexit gating and raw room content / occupant line formatting.


## [2.8.26]

### Fixed
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `do_who` switched-session parity**: `mud/commands/info.py` now mirrors ROM `do_who` by preferring the switched descriptor `original` character for output and title rendering instead of always showing the shell character.

### Changed
- **Stricter `do_who` output coverage**: `tests/integration/test_do_who_command.py` now includes exact ROM-style output assertions for switched sessions and representative fully-flagged player rows.


## [2.8.25]

### Fixed
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `do_equipment` slot order parity**: `mud/commands/inventory.py` now mirrors ROM `do_equipment` by iterating wear slots in numeric `MAX_WEAR` order instead of Python dict insertion order.
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `do_where` private-room parity**: `mud/commands/info.py` mode 1 now applies the ROM room-owner/private-room gate on the live session path, so mortals no longer see descriptor-backed players in genuinely private rooms.

### Changed
- **Stricter `inventory` / `equipment` / `where` regressions**: added ROM-exact layout assertions for `do_inventory` and `do_equipment`, plus a real descriptor-path private-room regression for `do_where`.


## [2.8.24]

### Fixed
- **`act_info.c` trust-rebuild: `whois` formatting parity**: `mud/commands/info_extended.py` now mirrors ROM descriptor-path `whois` behavior more closely, including race/class display, immortal rank labels, AFK/KILLER/THIEF flags via enums, and switched-descriptor `original` handling.
- **`score` player-race mapping**: fixed the player-facing race-name helper so playable race id `0` renders as `human` instead of the base-race sentinel `unique`.

### Changed
- **Stricter `act_info.c` regressions**: `tests/test_player_info_commands.py` now replaces several weak smoke assertions with ROM-exact `score` and `whois` output checks.
- **Trust-rebuild handoff updated**: `ACT_INFO_C_AUDIT.md` and the session docs now explicitly record that `act_info.c` is under observable-behavior revalidation rather than relying on legacy structural-audit completion claims.


## [2.8.23]

### Fixed
- **`score` parity and load-session hydration**: fixed ROM-visible `score` output so loaded characters now refresh live session `logon`, render race/class/title correctly, and use ROM-style low-level AC wording instead of stale helper-path values.
- **Runtime-path persistence regression coverage**: added a full WebSocket create → disconnect → reconnect test to prove completed character creation persists and the second login reaches `Password:` instead of restarting character creation.

### Changed
- **Verification language downgraded to match evidence**: README and session guidance now mark ROM parity as under active revalidation rather than fully certified, after a live `score` bug showed gaps in prior observable-behavior coverage.
- **Trust-rebuild program documented**: added a re-audit plan and a differential-testing design spec covering ROM-exact output, runtime-path verification, and data parity for future audit closure work.


## [2.8.22]

### Fixed
- **Area JSON boot/reset parity**: repaired the checked-in `data/areas/*.json` dataset and the ROM area loaders so world boot no longer emits the invalid O/P/D/G/E reset warning flood. This includes ROM-accurate room-door lock decoding, object `F` affect parsing, first-tilde string termination, and JSON room-sector preservation.

### Changed
- **Area dataset regeneration**: regenerated the checked-in area JSON files from their `.are` sources after the loader fixes, restoring missing object prototypes and corrected room topology across the shipped world data.
- **Stale test cleanup after area repair**: updated area/scan/mobprog parity tests to stop depending on previously broken topology or ambient RNG state.
- **Full-suite recertification**: the suite now reruns clean at `4567 passed, 4 skipped`.

## [2.8.21]

### Changed
- **README status refresh**: updated the public project status, audit coverage, test counts, and active-focus guidance so the README now matches the audited trackers and current session status.
- **Release wrap-up**: recertified the published repo state around the current fully green parity program (`4560 passed, 4 skipped`) and the completed 40/40 audit-bound ROM C file coverage.

## [2.8.20]

### Changed
- **Stability investigation recertified clean**: executed the queued descriptor/session reproduction subset and a full-suite rerun with no reproducing leak (`36 passed, 36 deselected` in the networking subset; full suite still `4560 passed, 4 skipped`).
- **Session guidance tightened**: `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` now records that descriptor/session cleanup work should not proceed without a deterministic reproduction, and points the next agent at the standing investigation plan only if a leak reappears.

## [2.8.19]

### Added
- **Stability / invariant hardening handoff plan**: added a concrete next-agent execution plan for descriptor/session global-state isolation, targeting `descriptor_list`, `character_registry`, telnet/session teardown, and any newly discovered cross-file invariant.

### Changed
- **Session handoff updated**: `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` now points at the stability / invariant hardening queue, with a dedicated handoff summary and explicit first verification commands for the next agent.

## [2.8.18]

### Added
- **Descriptor-backed `wiznet` regression coverage**: `tests/test_wiznet.py` now registers ROM-style playing descriptors for listeners and includes a stale-descriptor regression, so the suite exercises the production descriptor path instead of relying on the character-registry fallback.

### Fixed
- **`wiznet` descriptor-path immortal gate parity**: `mud/wiznet.py` now mirrors ROM `src/act_wiz.c:171-194` on the real descriptor path by rejecting NPC and non-immortal recipients before checking wiznet flags.

### Changed
- **Full-suite recertification**: the suite now reruns clean at `4560 passed, 4 skipped`.

## [2.8.17]

### Added
- **`BOARD-014` AFK parity coverage**: added ROM-backed integration tests for note-editor AFK ownership, including `note write`, `note send`, and the new `note forget` cancel path.

### Fixed
- **`BOARD-014` note-editor AFK parity**: `mud/commands/notes.py` and `mud/models/board.py` now mirror ROM `src/board.c` by setting AFK when note composition begins, clearing only note-owned AFK when posting or forgetting a note, and preserving manually enabled AFK.

### Changed
- **`board.c` audit closure**: `docs/parity/BOARD_C_AUDIT.md` and `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` now record `board.c` as fully closed with `BOARD-014` no longer deferred.
- **Full-suite recertification**: the suite now reruns clean at `4559 passed, 4 skipped`.

## [2.8.16]

### Fixed
- **`MUSIC-005` global-channel recipient parity**: `mud/music/__init__.py` now mirrors ROM `src/music.c:88-97` by iterating the ROM-style descriptor list, requiring `CON_PLAYING`, checking `COMM_NOMUSIC` / `COMM_QUIET` on `descriptor.original` when switched, and delivering the line to the active descriptor character.
- **`MUSIC-006` jukebox visibility parity**: jukebox room output now resolves `$p` per viewer, so recipients who cannot see the jukebox get ROM-style `"something"` fallback instead of a leaked short description. Implemented in `mud/music/__init__.py` with object visibility fallback in `mud/utils/act.py`.

### Changed
- **`music.c` audit closure**: `docs/parity/MUSIC_C_AUDIT.md` and `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` now record `music.c` at 100% with all six gaps closed.

## [2.8.15]

### Changed
- **Parity audit reconciliation**: refreshed stale `nanny.c` audit headers and the historical `save.c` tracker narrative so the docs match the verified codebase and enforced invariants (`INV-003`, `INV-008`).

## [2.8.14]

### Added
- **Deterministic ROM skill-improvement coverage**: `tests/integration/test_skills_integration.py` now enforces `check_improve()` on the live combat path, including the ROM rule that combat learning can continue above class adept up to 100.
- **Executable money and spell-affect integration coverage**: replaced stale skipped placeholders with live tests for drop-money consolidation, cursed no-remove equipment, poison damage-over-time, and plague contagion spread.

### Fixed
- **`check_improve()` adept-cap parity**: `mud/skills/registry.py` now mirrors ROM `src/skills.c` by allowing post-use learning through 100 instead of stopping at the class adept cap.
- **Plague contagion parity**: `mud/game_loop.py` now applies a full `AffectData` record to newly infected victims during `char_update()`, matching ROM `src/update.c:839-840`.
- **Kick ROM parity test stability**: `tests/test_skill_combat_rom_parity.py` now isolates `check_improve()` from the kick damage-roll assertions so the test verifies the ROM damage call instead of incidental follow-up RNG.

### Changed
- **Integration coverage tracker reconciliation**: the skills and spell-affects slices now record their real enforced status, and the stale info-command / equipment / group-combat historical narratives were collapsed to canonical current-state notes.
- **Full-suite recertification**: the suite now reruns clean at `4553 passed, 4 skipped`.

## [2.8.13]

### Added
- **ROM wear-off suppression enforcement**: added targeted regression coverage for `char_update()` and `obj_update()` so consecutive same-type affect expirations now stay locked to ROM `src/update.c` semantics, including single-message suppression for object wear-off.
- **Deterministic `mobile_update()` wander-gate enforcement**: added isolated integration coverage for `ACT_STAY_AREA`, `ACT_OUTDOORS`, and `ACT_INDOORS` movement restrictions using synthetic room topology instead of boot-world assumptions.

### Fixed
- **`GL-010` character affect wear-off parity**: `mud/affects/engine.py` now preserves merged spell effects while any same-type `AffectData` remains active, matching ROM `src/update.c:762-786`.
- **`GL-017` object affect wear-off parity**: `mud/game_loop.py` now suppresses duplicate same-type object wear-off messages exactly once per tick, matching ROM `src/update.c:939-957`.

### Changed
- **Parity tracker reconciliation**: cross-file invariant and integration-coverage trackers now record the enforced wander-gate and wear-off parity slices, and the full suite is recertified at `4547 passed, 10 skipped`.

## [2.8.12]

### Added
- **Canonical ROM `weapon_table`**: added `/mud/models/weapon_table.py` as the shared source for weapon class name, school weapon vnum, weapon type, and linked proficiency mapping, then wired combat, character-load skill seeding, and creation-time weapon handling to it.
- **`NANNY-010` reconnect descriptor sweep**: `mud/net/connection.py` now mirrors ROM `src/nanny.c:307-352` by sweeping duplicate descriptors on break-connect reconnect, including the switched-immortal `original->name` branch.

### Fixed
- **`COMM-005` duplicate-newbie parity**: new-character name validation now closes matching non-playing duplicate descriptors and emits ROM's `Double newbie alert` wiznet notice.
- **`FLAG-002` settable-bit preservation**: `do_flag` now preserves ROM `settable=FALSE` bits across the `=` operator for `act`, `plr`, and `comm` fields.
- **Test determinism and suite stability**: stabilized wiznet and advancement integration tests by isolating shared descriptor-list state and replacing wall-clock ROM RNG seeding with a fixed Mitchell-Moore seed.

### Changed
- **Parity tracker reconciliation**: refreshed stale audit/tracker rows for `act_obj.c`, `act_wiz.c`, `scan.c`, `special.c`, `healer.c`, `const/tables/lookup`, `fight.c`, and `comm.c` so docs match the verified codebase.
- **Full-suite recertification**: the suite now reruns clean at `4535 passed, 11 skipped`.

## [2.8.11]

### Fixed
- **`log` command trust parity**: restored the dispatcher registration for `log` to ROM `src/interp.c` level `L1` (`MAX_LEVEL - 1`) and updated the admin-logging tests to use a ROM-valid immortal trust level instead of `LEVEL_HERO`.

## [2.8.10]

### Fixed
- **Legacy character-row compatibility**: `mud/db/migrations.py` now backfills the DB-canonical `characters` columns that `load_character()` queries, so older SQLite databases with only the pre-2.8.0 schema can still load characters after migration. `mud/models/character.py:from_orm` and `mud/account/account_service.py:create_character` also keep persistent `points` aligned with ROM creation-point state.

## [2.8.9]

### Fixed
- **Command parser test parity**: leading punctuation commands now follow ROM `src/interp.c` single-character tokenization, restoring apostrophe-as-`say` handling. Updated scripted-session/command tests to match current ROM-faithful transcript ordering and scan output, and replaced a stale non-takeable school-sword pickup assumption with an explicit takeable test object.

## [2.8.8]

### Fixed
- **Admin `log` command parity**: dispatcher trust for `log` now matches ROM `src/interp.c`/`src/act_wiz.c`, `cmd_log` keeps the persisted `PLR_LOG` bit and `log_commands` boolean in sync, and admin player lookup now resolves through the live runtime character registry so `log <player>` works reliably.

## [2.8.7]

### Fixed
- **hedit RecursionError**: `_interpret_hedit` fallthrough on unknown commands now returns `"Unknown help editor command: <cmd>\n\r"` so `_should_fallback_from_olc` routes to the normal command table instead of re-entering hedit via `process_command`. Mirrors ROM `src/hedit.c:258` `interpret(ch, arg)` without the re-entry loop.

### Changed
- **tests/test_builder_hedit.py rewrite**: All 19 stale tests replaced with 23 ROM-parity tests that verify actual `cmd_hedit`/`cmd_hesave` behavior (ROM-exact strings: `"HEdit: There is no default help to edit.\n\r"`, `"Ok.\n\r"`, `"Keyword : [...]"`, `"Level   : [...]"`, etc.). Covers entry-point guard, `new` subcommand, session open/show/keyword/level/text/done, session-lost recovery, unknown-command non-recursion, and full `hesave` workflow.

## [2.8.6]

### Fixed
- **FIGHT-002 safe-room parity**: `mud/combat/engine.py:apply_damage` now mirrors ROM `src/fight.c:725-733` by re-checking `is_safe(ch, victim)` before any fighting-state or HP mutation. This stops melee damage, weapon procs, and other `apply_damage()`-backed attack paths from landing after combatants are moved into a safe room mid-fight. Regression coverage: `tests/integration/test_fight_c_safe_room_damage_gate.py`.

## [2.8.5]

### Fixed
- **FIGHT-001 combat-entry parity**: `mud/commands/combat.py:do_kill` now mirrors ROM `src/fight.c:2815-2817` by entering combat through `multi_hit(ch, victim, TYPE_UNDEFINED)` instead of a single `attack_round()`. This restores haste / second-attack / third-attack follow-up swings for `kill` command combat starts. Regression coverage: `tests/integration/test_fight_c_do_kill_parity.py`.

## [2.8.4]

### Changed
- **Pyright cleanup across test suite.** Eliminated ~30 pre-existing `reportOptionalMemberAccess` / `reportArgumentType` / `reportAttributeAccessIssue` warnings across `tests/test_boards.py`, `tests/test_logging_admin.py`, `tests/test_commands.py`, `tests/test_wiznet.py`, `tests/test_affects.py`, and `tests/test_account_auth.py`. Approach: per-call-site `assert x is not None` guards on `Optional` returns from `find_board(...)`, `from_orm(db_char)`, `load_character(...)`, `Character.pcdata`, etc.; `cast(StreamReader, …)` / `cast(TelnetStream, …)` / `cast(Room, …)` for test doubles; widened `DummyWriter.write` overrides to `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`; initialized possibly-unbound `menu_task: asyncio.Task | None = None`; `# type: ignore[arg-type]` on the two intentional `dam_type=None` cases that exercise edge-case handling. No behavior change; tests still pass at the prior pre-existing-failure baseline.

## [2.8.3]

### Changed
- **Extract `time_info` persistence to `mud/world/time_persistence.py`.** `save_time_info`, `load_time_info`, `TimeSave`, and `TIME_FILE` now live in the new module. `tests/test_time_persistence.py` updated to import from the new location.
- **Extract serialization helpers to `mud/db/serializers.py`.** All live helpers imported by `mud/account/account_manager.py` (`_normalize_int_list`, `_serialize_colour_table`, `_serialize_object`, `_serialize_pet`, `_serialize_skill_map`, `_serialize_groups`) and `mud/models/character.py:from_orm` (`_apply_colour_table`, `_normalize_int_list`, `_deserialize_object`, `ObjectSave`, `_deserialize_pet`) now live in `mud/db/serializers.py`. Both importers updated.

### Removed
- **`mud/persistence.py` deleted.** The deprecated stub (holding only the two extracted surfaces above, plus dead code from the now-gone JSON-pfile path) is gone. No behavior change; `mud/persistence` was already a non-functional deprecation banner since 2.8.1.

## [2.8.2]

### Changed
- **Type cleanup on the new DB-canonical persistence surface.** `save_character_to_db` now types its `session` parameter as `sqlalchemy.orm.Session` (TYPE_CHECKING import) instead of `object`, dropping the `# type: ignore[union-attr]` on the `session.query` call. `mud/models/character.py:from_orm` casts `_deserialize_object(...)` to `Object | None` at the equipment-restore site so the `restored_equipment: dict[str, Object]` annotation is honored. No behavior change; pyright cleanup only. 25/25 critical persistence tests still green.

## [2.8.1]

### Changed
- **INV-008 reversal — Phase 2: DB-canonical persistence is live.** `mud/account/account_manager.save_character` and `load_character` now hit the SQL `Character` row directly (via Phase 1's `save_character_to_db` and `Character.from_orm`). The JSON-pfile delegation is removed; `mud/persistence.py` keeps only `time_info` save/load and a few ROM-only helpers (deprecated banner at module top). `tests/integration/test_inv008_persistence_coherence.py` now asserts the DB-canonical round-trip including a new `test_inv008_db_canonical_is_sole_path` case. INV-008 is ✅ ENFORCED again under the new architecture.

### Removed
- **JSON-pfile test files** — deleted because the surface they covered no longer exists: `tests/test_persistence.py`, `tests/test_persistence_password_hash.py`, `tests/test_player_save_format.py`, `tests/test_inventory_persistence.py`, `tests/integration/test_pet_persistence.py`, `tests/integration/test_save_load_parity.py`, `tests/integration/test_tables_001_affect_migration.py`. Persistence coverage is now provided by `tests/integration/test_db_canonical_round_trip.py` (7 tests) + `tests/integration/test_inv008_persistence_coherence.py` (5 tests). The 3 pre-existing `test_persistence.py` / `test_inventory_persistence.py` failures (broken-area-JSON / vnum 3022) are no longer relevant — those tests went away with the surface they tested.

## [2.8.0]

### Added
- **INV-008 reversal — Phase 1 of 2: DB-canonical persistence schema.** Following the discovery that `mud/account/account_service.create_character` and `mud/models/character.py:from_orm` still write/read the DB row at first-login (the JSON-pfile path was load-bearing only after first save), the project is reversing course on INV-008: the DB row is being made canonical for ALL player state, the JSON pfile path will be deleted in Phase 2. This commit extends the `Character` SQLAlchemy model with 39 new columns to hold every field `PlayerSave` round-trips (scalars: `max_hit`, `mana`, `move`, `gold`, `silver`, `exp`, `trust`, `invis_level`, `incog_level`, `saving_throw`, `hitroll`, `damroll`, `wimpy`, `position`, `played`, `logon`, `lines`, `prompt`, `prefix`, `title`, `bamfin`, `bamfout`, `security`, `points`, `last_level`, `affected_by`, `comm`, `wiznet`, `log_commands`, `pfile_version`, `board`; JSON columns: `mod_stat`, `armor`, `conditions`, `aliases`, `skills`, `groups`, `last_notes`, `colours`, `pet_state`, `inventory_state`, `equipment_state`). Extended `Character.from_orm` to hydrate every new column. New `save_character_to_db(session, char)` in `mud/account/account_manager.py` writes the full state via UPDATE. Round-trip proven by 7 new tests in `tests/integration/test_db_canonical_round_trip.py` (all green). Public `save_character` / `load_character` surface unchanged in this phase — Phase 2 swaps the implementations and deletes `mud/persistence.py`. INV-008 reopened in the cross-file invariants tracker.
- **`docs/parity/INV008_REVERSAL_AUDIT.md`** — 71-field map (PlayerSave → Character columns), `from_orm` audit, new code surface, caller surface, INV-008 test rewrite plan, and risk register; produced as the spec for both phases of the migration.

### Notes
- Pre-existing test slowness (full suite ~12 min vs. AGENTS.md's "~16s") and ~30 pre-existing test failures verified at the pre-Phase-1 baseline (git stash). Not introduced by this commit.

## [2.7.6]

### Changed
- **INV-008 DUAL-LOAD-CHARACTER-COHERENCE consolidated (hybrid path).** `mud/account/account_manager.py` is now a thin shim delegating `load_character` and `save_character` to `mud.persistence` (the JSON pfile path). The DB row (`mud/db/models.py:Character`) keeps `name` + `password_hash` for auth only; gameplay columns are vestigial and will be dropped in a later schema-migration session. Field-level audit at `docs/parity/INV008_DIVERGENCE_AUDIT.md`. No data migration was required — pre-launch.
- **`mud/persistence.py:PlayerSave` now persists `password_hash`** so the JSON pfile is the single ROM-faithful source of truth for all PC state, including auth credentials. `save_character` writes `pcdata.pwd`; `load_character` restores it. The shim's `save_character` also syncs the hash to the DB row so the auth path (`account_service.login_character`) stays consistent after `do_password`.

### Fixed
- **30+ PC fields previously dropped on every WS logout** (because the DB-backed `account_manager.save_character` only persisted ~18 columns). Now restored on next login: current mana / current move, gold, silver, exp, hitroll, damroll, saving throw, AC array, wimpy, position, mod_stat array, comm bitfield, affected_by, wiznet flags, conditions (drunk/full/thirst/hunger), full skill learned-percent map, aliases, colour table, prompt, title, bamfin/bamfout, played time, logon timestamp, pets, item timer/value/condition/enchanted/affects on inventory and equipment, container contents.

### Added
- **INV-008 enforcement test** (`tests/integration/test_inv008_persistence_coherence.py`): four cases asserting the `account_manager` shim round-trips full gameplay state, registers loaded characters in `character_registry` (INV-003), preserves `pcdata.pwd`, and restores room placement. INV-008 flipped from ⚠️ KNOWN DIVERGENCE → ✅ ENFORCED. **All 8 cross-file invariants are now ✅ ENFORCED.**
- `docs/parity/INV008_DIVERGENCE_AUDIT.md`: field-level provenance audit (51 vs 29 fields, caller surface, recommendation).

## [2.7.5]

### Added
- **INV-007 RNG-DETERMINISM enforcement test** (`tests/test_rng_determinism.py`): scans every `.py` file under `mud/combat/`, `mud/skills/`, and `mud/spells/` for `import random`, `from random`, or `random.` and fails with path:line detail if any match. Runs in <1s. INV-007 flipped from ⚠️ ENFORCED BY CONVENTION → ✅ ENFORCED. 7 of 8 cross-file invariants are now ✅ ENFORCED; INV-008 (DUAL-LOAD-CHARACTER-COHERENCE) remains a known divergence.

### Removed
- **Vestigial `stdlib Random` from `SkillRegistry`** (`mud/skills/registry.py`): `__init__` accepted `rng: Random | None` and stored `self.rng`, but `self.rng` was never read — all rolls in registry.py already went through `rng_mm`. Removed the dead field, the dead parameter, and the `from random import Random` import. `tests/test_skills.py:load_registry` updated accordingly. Required before INV-007's grep test could be written cleanly.

## [2.7.4]

### Added
- **INV-005 SAME-ROOM-COMBAT-ONLY enforcement test** (`tests/integration/test_inv005_same_room_combat.py`): proves `mud/game_loop.py:violence_tick` skips `multi_hit` and stops fighting when attacker and victim are in different rooms (ROM `src/fight.c:violence_update`). Plus a same-room sanity case so a flipped equality wouldn't silently pass.
- **INV-006 FIGHTING-POINTER-COHERENCE enforcement test** (`tests/integration/test_inv006_fighting_pointer_coherence.py`): proves `mud/combat/engine.py:stop_fighting(victim, both=True)` sweeps `character_registry` and clears every attacker pointing at the victim (ROM `src/fight.c:stop_fighting(victim, TRUE)`); inverse case confirms `both=False` does not sweep.
- Both invariants flipped from ⚠️ VERIFIED MANUALLY → ✅ ENFORCED in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`.
- **Cross-File Invariants tracker** (`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`): new top-level parity doc enumerating contracts the per-file audit methodology can't enforce on its own (single-delivery, registry membership, prompt-render-after-raw_kill, etc.). Eight INV-NNN entries seeded from this year's bug history; each has a stable ID, ROM mechanism, Python enforcement point, and regression test (or an action-item placeholder when the test is still missing).
- **AGENTS.md "Cross-File Invariants" section**: methodology note explaining what per-file audits miss and how to use the new tracker. Tracker added to the "Trackers" table.
- **rom-parity-audit skill update**: Phase 2 now requires following the call chain across module boundaries and consulting the cross-file invariants tracker; Phase 5 requires citing relevant INV-NNN statuses in each tracker row's Notes column ("Audited (per-file)" replaces bare "Audited").

### Changed
- `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md`: `comm.c`, `fight.c`, and `save.c` rows annotated with the cross-file invariants they touch and the bugs the per-file audit missed (single-delivery, prompt clamp, registry membership). Per-file ratings preserved; the new annotations make the audit's actual coverage explicit.


## [2.7.3]

### Fixed
- **Combat parity (death path)**: Combat messages now reach connected PCs exactly once. `mud/combat/engine.py:_push_message` previously appended every message to `char.messages` AND scheduled an async send, and `mud/net/connection.py:1756` unconditionally drained `char.messages` after every command — so each combat line was delivered TWICE to WebSocket clients. Live repro: PC dies, types `look`, sees the entire combat sequence (including "You have been KILLED!!") replayed milliseconds later, making it appear they died twice. ROM `src/comm.c:write_to_buffer` is one-shot. Per `docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md`, the mailbox is fallback-only for tests/disconnected characters; fix returns immediately after the async dispatch when a connection exists.
- **Combat parity (prompt display)**: `bust_a_prompt` now clamps displayed hit to >= 0. The death path could leave `char.hit` negative between `update_pos` setting `Position.DEAD` (at hit <= -11) and `raw_kill` clamping to `max(1, hit)` — Python's async dispatch can interleave a prompt render in that window, exposing the negative transient. ROM never shows negative hp because `raw_kill` always finishes first in its single-threaded loop. Display-only clamp at the two render sites (default prompt + `%h` token).
- **Combat parity (death-path comments)**: `_handle_death` documents the bidirectional fighting-pointer clear and its relationship with `raw_kill → _stop_fighting`'s `char_list` sweep. ROM ref: `src/fight.c:damage` death branch.

### Added
- `tests/test_prompt_clamps_hp.py` — 4 cases guarding prompt clamp (default + custom `%h`).
- `tests/integration/test_message_delivery_no_duplicate.py` — connected PC gets one async send, no mailbox queue; disconnected falls back to mailbox.
- `tests/integration/test_pc_death_no_message_replay.py` — end-to-end: pushes the actual death-message sequence, drives the read-loop drain manually, asserts "You have been KILLED!!" appears exactly once across both passes.
- `tests/integration/test_pc_death_keeps_connection.py` — regression guard that `raw_kill` keeps the PC in `character_registry`, in the death room, with hit/mana/move >= 1, position `RESTING`, connection intact.
- `mud/net/connection.py` — diagnostic logging upgrade: read-loop's outer `except` now prints `type(exc).__name__: exc!r` plus traceback so future disconnect causes are visible in server stdout.

## [2.7.2]

### Fixed
- Restore `version` field in `pyproject.toml` (accidentally dropped in `cdcd0cc`).
- Combat one-way bug: `mud/account/account_manager.load_character` now appends loaded PCs to `character_registry` so `violence_tick`/`char_update`/idle pump iterate them. Mirrors ROM `src/save.c:fread_char` `char_list` membership.
- World mob spawning: regenerated `resets` for 46 of 54 JSON area files via `scripts/patch_json_resets.py` so the school arena and other populated areas spawn ROM mobs on boot.
- BOARD-010: `note read again` is now a no-op (ROM `src/board.c:569-572`).

### Changed
- Reconciled `BOARD_C_AUDIT.md`, `OLC_C_AUDIT.md`, and `ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` against current implementation; folded several stale-test fixes (`test_save_load_parity`, `test_olc_alist`, `test_spell_affects_persistence`, `test_tables_001_affect_migration`, `test_nanny_login_parity`, `test_fighting_state`, `test_olc_save`) and added `tests/test_obj_loader.py`.
- Session summaries added under `docs/sessions/` for the 2026-05-02 work (combat triage, board audit, OLC audit, asave cleanup, broad-suite triage / JSON itemtype fix).


### Fixed
- **OLC-004/005**: Active OLC editors now support ROM-style `commands` listings with five fixed-width columns, mirroring `src/olc.c:153-209`.
- **OLC-010/015**: `do_olc` / `editor_table[]` ported — `olc <area|room|object|mobile|mpcode|hedit>` now dispatches to the real per-editor entry points via prefix matching (`str_prefix` parity), NPC guard, and remainder-arg forwarding, mirroring ROM `src/olc.c:646-690`. Both `olc` and `edit` command aliases are live. Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_010_015_do_olc_router.py` (14 cases).
- **OLC_SAVE-014**: `cmd_asave <vnum>` now silent on success (ROM `src/olc_save.c:982-995`)
- **OLC_SAVE-015**: `cmd_asave world` returns `"You saved the world.\n\r"` (ROM exact)
- **OLC_SAVE-016**: `cmd_asave changed` returns `"Saved zones:\n\r"` + per-area rows + `"None.\n\r"` fallback (ROM exact)
- **OLC_SAVE-017**: `cmd_asave area` returns `"Area saved.\n\r"` (ROM exact)
- **BOARD-010**: `note read again` is now a no-op (returns `""`) — mirrors ROM `src/board.c:569-572` empty `if`-body
- **MPEDIT-003**: Added `MprogCode` dataclass + `mprog_code_registry` dict + `get_mprog_index()` — mirrors ROM `MPROG_CODE` struct and `mprog_list` linked list (`src/olc_mpcode.c`)
- **MPEDIT-002**: `do_mpedit` now looks up `mprog_code_registry` (not `mob_prototypes`); opens `mpedit` session silently on success; exact Spanish error strings; `create` branch delegates to `_mpedit_create`
- **MPEDIT-001**: `_interpret_mpedit` session loop — smash_tilde, empty→show, `done` silent, security re-check, area=NULL→edit_done, dispatch table, fallback to `interpret()`
- **MPEDIT-004**: `_mpedit_show` — ROM exact format `"Vnum:       [%d]\n\rCode:\n\r%s\n\r"`
- **MPEDIT-005**: `_mpedit_code` — no-arg enters string_edit mode; arg → `"Syntax: code\n\r"`
- **MPEDIT-006**: `_mpedit_list` — `[%3d] (%c) %5d\n\r` format; `*/space/?` builder indicator; `all`/area filter; exact empty messages
- **HEDIT-002**: `hedit level` accepts -1..MAX_LEVEL; exact ROM error message
- **HEDIT-003/004**: `hedit keyword`/`hedit level` return `"Ok.\n\r"` / exact ROM syntax strings
- **HEDIT-005**: `hedit text` no-arg is valid (triggers `string_append`); arg present → `"Syntax: text\n\r"`
- **HEDIT-006**: security check returns `"HEdit: Insufficient security to edit helps.\n\r"` (with `\n\r`)
- **HEDIT-007**: empty input in hedit session → `hedit_show` (not syntax string)
- **HEDIT-008**: `done` is silent (returns `""`, no verbose save message)
- **HEDIT-009**: unknown hedit command falls back to normal command table (`interpret`)
- **HEDIT-010**: `hedit delete` implemented — removes from `help_entries` + all keyword buckets
- **HEDIT-011**: `hedit list all` / `list area` implemented with ROM 4-column `%3d. %-14.14s` format
- **HEDIT-012**: `do_hedit new <topic>` path correctly creates entry + enters editor
- **HEDIT-013**: `do_hedit <keyword>` uses `is_name` word-match (not exact key lookup)
- **HEDIT-014**: `hedit_level`/`hedit_keyword` return `"Ok.\n\r"` (triggers `had->changed = TRUE` equivalent) (`src/olc_act.c:770-790`) — sets `pArea->age`, validates numeric arg, does not set `changed` (ROM parity). 6 integration tests added.
- **OLC-012/013/014**: `redit`/`oedit`/`medit` fallback to `interpret()` verified — `_should_fallback_from_olc()` + `_process_descriptor_input()` returning `None` correctly re-dispatches unknown OLC input through the normal command table (mirrors ROM `src/olc.c:519-521`, `575-577`, `631-633`). 14 integration tests added in `tests/integration/test_olc_012_014_editor_fallback.py`.
- **OLC-009**: `medit` missing subcommands ported — `act`, `affect`, `armor`, `form`, `part`, `imm`, `res`, `vuln`, `off`, `size`, `hitdice`, `manadice`, `damdice`, `position`, `addmprog`, `delmprog` now dispatched from `_interpret_medit`. Helpers mirror ROM `src/olc_act.c:4142-4969`. Flag toggles use XOR pattern (act/affect/form/part/imm/res/vuln/off); `act` always re-sets `IS_NPC` (ROM:4153); dice stored as `tuple[int,int,int]`; `addmprog` validates vnum against mob_registry; `delmprog` splices list and clears mprog_flags bit. Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_009_medit_missing_cmds.py` (30 cases).
- **OLC-008**: `oedit` missing subcommands ported — `addaffect`, `addapply`, `delaffect`, `extra`, `wear` now dispatched from `_interpret_oedit`. Helpers mirror ROM `src/olc_act.c:2818-3450`: flag-value toggle for `extra`/`wear` (ExtraFlag/WearFlag XOR), affect list append/splice for `addaffect`/`addapply`/`delaffect` with `TO_OBJECT=1`, `type=-1`, `duration=-1` ROM defaults. Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_008_oedit_missing_cmds.py` (16 cases).
- **OLC-007**: `redit` missing subcommands ported — `rlist`, `mlist`, `olist`, `mshow`, `oshow` are now dispatched from `_interpret_redit`. Helpers `_redit_rlist/mlist/olist/mshow/oshow` mirror ROM `src/olc_act.c:329-570` (3-column vnum/name listing, `is_name` filtering, item-type prefix matching, mob/obj show via `_medit_show`/`_oedit_show`). Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_007_redit_list_show.py` (16 cases).
- **OLC-011**: `aedit` flag-toggle prefix ported — typing a bare `area_flags` name (e.g. `loading`, `added`) inside an active aedit session now toggles the flag via `flag_value(AreaFlag, command)` and sends `"Flag toggled."`, mirroring ROM `src/olc.c:443-449`. Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_011_aedit_flag_toggle.py` (7 cases).

## [2.7.1] — update.c Parity Gap Closures (GL-004/005/009/011/012/013/014/015/018)

### Fixed
- **GL-004**: `mana_gain` now uses `room.mana_rate` instead of `room.heal_rate`; rooms with custom mana rates now regenerate mana at the correct rate (ROM `update.c:300`).
- **GL-005**: `mana_gain` furniture bonus now reads `value[4]` (mana bonus) instead of `value[3]` (hit bonus) (ROM `update.c:218,300`).
- **GL-009**: NPC `char_update` wanders-home: out-of-zone NPCs that are not fighting and not charmed now have a 5% per-tick chance of being extracted (despawned) — mirrors ROM `update.c:688-696`. Previously missing entirely.
- **GL-011**: Plague tick implemented: spreads to room occupants (5% per-tick per target, saves vs disease), drains mana and move, and deals HP damage per tick (ROM `update.c:794-846`). Previously missing.
- **GL-012**: Poison tick implemented: sends "You shiver and suffer" message and deals `level // 10 + 1` HP damage per tick (ROM `update.c:848-862`). Previously missing.
- **GL-013**: INCAP position tick damage: 50% chance of 1 HP damage per tick (ROM `update.c:864-867`). Previously missing.
- **GL-014**: MORTAL position tick damage: 1 HP damage every tick unconditionally (ROM `update.c:868-871`). Previously missing.
- **GL-015**: `_idle_to_limbo` now calls `stop_fighting(ch, both=True)` instead of `ch.fighting = None`, properly cleaning both sides of any fight (ROM `update.c:741-744`).
- **GL-018**: Decay messages for objects inside an untakeable pit (vnum 3010) are now suppressed (ROM `update.c:1017-1018`). Previously objects inside a pit always broadcast their decay message to the room.

### Added
- `_char_update_tick_effects()` helper in `mud/game_loop.py` encapsulating all per-tick damage effects (plague, poison, INCAP, MORTAL).
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_update_c_parity.py` — 11 tests covering all closed gaps.

## [2.7.0] — ROM Character-First Login

### Changed

- **Login model replaced with ROM-faithful character-first auth** — the
  `PlayerAccount` ORM table and account-layer have been removed entirely.
  Characters now authenticate directly (mirroring ROM `nanny.c`/`save.c`):
  the server prompts `Name:`, branches to `Password:` for returning chars or
  `Did I get that right, <Name> (Y/N)?` → `New password:` → `Confirm
  password:` for new ones.  The `PlayerAccount` class is gone; `password_hash`
  now lives on the `Character` row.
- **`_select_character` simplified** — no character-selection menu; the login
  name *is* the character name, matching ROM's single-character-per-login model.
- **`login_with_host` / `login_character`** updated to query `Character` directly;
  `create_account` / `list_characters` / `release_account` kept as thin shims
  for call-site compatibility.
- **Reconnect flow** — duplicate-session detection and reconnect prompt now
  occur at the `Name:` stage (before password), matching ROM nanny behaviour.

### Fixed

- **`negotiate_ansi_prompt` test helper** — was waiting for `b"Account: "` after
  the ANSI negotiation; updated to `b"Name: "` to match the new login prompt.
- **`test_select_character_allows_permit_from_permit_host`** — monkeypatched
  `load_character` now uses single-arg signature; `account` arg updated to be
  the character row directly (ROM model).
- **`test_websocket_boots_loaded_world_and_uses_account_login_flow`** — rewritten
  for ROM flow (`Name:` → confirm → `New password:` → `Confirm password:`).
- **`test_telnet_server_handles_multiple_connections`** and
  **`test_telnet_break_connect_prompts_and_reconnects`** — updated to ROM login
  flow (no `Character:` prompt step).

### Fixed

- **Combat message delivery** — combat messages (damage, parry, dodge, position
  changes, weapon specials) now reach connected players immediately via
  fire-and-forget asyncio tasks, matching ROM C's `write_to_buffer()` real-time
  delivery. Previously messages were queued in `char.messages` and only drained
  when the player typed a command, causing combat to appear frozen.
  See `docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md` for the design rationale.

### Changed (v2.6.108)

- **JSON_LOADER_C_AUDIT.md** — all 18 gaps now closed (remaining 6 in this batch).
- JSON loader applies per-type value coercion (`_parse_item_values`) at load time, mirroring ROM `src/db2.c:429-478` and the `.are` loader path.
- `attack_lookup` now handles numeric-string inputs (in-range passes through, out-of-range falls to name prefix-match), consistent with `_skill_lookup`/`_liq_lookup`/`_weapon_type_lookup`.

### Fixed (json_loader.py parity closures — JSONLD-001,003,015,016,017,018)

- **JSONLD-001** — Object keyword list populated from JSON `keywords` key (with `name` fallback) so `is_name()` matching works on JSON-loaded objects. Converter (`convert_are_to_json.py`) now emits `keywords` separately from display `name`. All 44 area JSONs regenerated.
- **JSONLD-003** — Object `level` field emitted by converter (`convert_are_to_json.py:object_to_dict`) and read by JSON loader. All area JSONs regenerated with `level` for every object.
- **JSONLD-015** — JSON loader now calls `_parse_item_values` (from `obj_loader`) to apply per-type value coercion at load time. `attack_lookup` updated to handle pre-resolved integer values from JSON.
- **JSONLD-016** — Object `short_descr` lowercased-first and `description` uppercased-first at load time, mirroring ROM `src/db2.c:869-870`.
- **JSONLD-017** — Room `light` verified at dataclass default 0 (ROM `src/db.c:1164`). Explicit init deemed redundant — closed-by-design.
- **JSONLD-018** — JSON-only `ROOM_NO_MOB` auto-add on no-exit rooms removed. ROM does not do this; rooms now behave identically to the `.are` path.

### Changed (v2.6.107)

- Includes previously uncommitted JSONLD-012, OLC, and build changes from earlier session.

### Fixed (act_wiz.c stat family parity closures — WIZ-039..044)

- **WIZ-039** — `do_mstat` practices now uses caller's NPC status (`char.is_npc`) instead of victim's, matching ROM `IS_NPC(ch) ? 0 : victim->practice`.
- **WIZ-040** — `do_mstat` Hit/Dam now use `get_hitroll(victim)` / `get_damroll(victim)` (including STR-app bonuses) per ROM `GET_HITROLL` / `GET_DAMROLL`.
- **WIZ-041** — `do_mstat` Age/Played/Last_Level now computed via `get_age(victim)`, `(played + current_time - logon) / 3600`, and `pcdata.last_level` per ROM instead of hardcoded 17/0/0.
- **WIZ-042** — `do_mstat` Carry weight now uses `get_carry_weight(victim) // 10` (includes coin burden) per ROM.
- **WIZ-043** — `do_ostat` Number/Weight line now uses `_object_carry_number(obj)` and `_get_obj_weight(obj)` per ROM `get_obj_number` / `get_obj_weight` / `get_true_weight`.
- **WIZ-044** — `do_rstat` Objects list now has 3 spaces after colon per ROM `".\n\rObjects:   "`.

### Fixed (JSON loader parity closures — v2.6.105)

- **JSONLD-012** — JSON-loaded mob `race` values now resolve through ROM `race_lookup` into integer `race_table` indexes at load time, matching ROM `src/db2.c:234`. Race flag merging, OLC JSON save, and `medit show` display now handle integer-backed mob races without losing the human-readable race name.

### Fixed (JSON loader parity closures — v2.6.104)

- **JSONLD-009** — JSON-loaded areas now default `security` to 9 for both supported JSON formats, preserving explicit JSON values when present. This mirrors ROM `src/db.c:452` / `src/db.c:531` and restores the expected OLC builder-security default.
- **JSONLD-010** — Format 1 JSON areas now hydrate `credits` from the JSON payload when present, mirroring ROM `src/db.c:457`.
- **JSONLD-013** — JSON room `clan` values now resolve through `lookup_clan_id`, including ROM-style prefix matching, instead of preserving raw strings. Mirrors ROM `src/db.c:1192`.
- **JSONLD-014** — JSON `D` resets now apply boot-time door state and are discarded rather than retained in `area.resets` / `room.resets`, mirroring ROM `src/db.c:1058-1104`.

### Fixed (JSON loader parity closures — v2.6.103)

- **JSONLD-002** — Object `extra_descr` now stores `ExtraDescr` instances instead of raw dicts, matching the `.are` loader and ROM (`src/db2.c:571-580`). Consumer sites no longer need dict-aware fallback.
- **JSONLD-004** — Mob `hit`/`mana`/`damage` int tuples now parsed from `hit_dice`/`mana_dice`/`damage_dice` strings at load time via `_parse_dice_tuple`, matching ROM (`src/db2.c:251-269`). The `templates.py:_parse_dice` fallback still works as defense.
- **JSONLD-005** — Object `wear_flags` now converted from ROM letter string to int bitmask via `convert_flags_from_letters(WearFlag)`, matching the `.are` loader (`obj_loader.py:389`).
- **JSONLD-006** — Object `affected` list now populated with typed `Affect` instances from `affects` dicts, matching ROM (`src/db2.c:519-568`). `obj.affected` is no longer empty on JSON-loaded objects.
- **JSONLD-007** — Mob `hitroll` now populated from JSON `hitroll` key (falling back to `thac0`), matching ROM (`src/db2.c:248`). Previously `hitroll` was always 0 for JSON-loaded mobs.
- **JSONLD-008** — Mob `off_flags`/`imm_flags`/`res_flags`/`vuln_flags` int fields now populated after `merge_race_flags` via `_to_int_flags`, matching ROM (`src/db2.c:279-286`). Previously these stayed 0 on JSON-loaded mobs.
- **JSONLD-011** — Mob `form`/`parts` now converted from letter strings to int bitmasks after `merge_race_flags`, matching ROM (`src/db2.c:295-297`). Previously `IS_SET(mob.form, FORM_EDIBLE)` would fail with `ValueError`.

### Fixed (in-game runtime bugs surfaced 2026-04-30)

- `BUG-MOBHP` — Every JSON-loaded mob spawned with `max_hit=0` / `current_hp=1`, so look reported "awful condition" universally and a level 1 PC could one-shot Hassan (level 45). `mud/spawning/templates.py:_parse_dice` short-circuited on the default `(0,0,0)` primary tuple before consulting the `hit_dice` / `mana_dice` / `damage_dice` string fallback the JSON loader populated. Now treats all-zero primary as "unset" and falls through. ROM ref: `src/db.c:fread_mobile`. (commit `715469d`)
- `BUG-CORPSEINT` — `get coins corpse` raised `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'npc_corpse'`. `mud/loaders/json_loader.py:_load_objects_from_json` now routes prototype `item_type` through `_resolve_item_type_code` (mirroring the legacy `.are` loader), and `mud/commands/inventory.py:do_get` defensively coerces. ROM ref: `src/db.c:load_objects` `flag_value`. (commit `0f0d871`)
- `BUG-EDDICT` — `look fountain`, `read letter` raised `'dict' object has no attribute 'description'` because the JSON loader stores `extra_descr` as raw dicts and `mud/world/look.py` accessed `.description` attribute-style. Added `_ed_fields(ed)` helper accepting both shapes. ROM ref: `src/act_info.c:do_look`, `EXTRA_DESCR_DATA`. (commit `cb4eed7`)
- `BUG-NLOWER` — `look corpse`, `open south`, `open door` raised `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'` because JSON-loaded prototypes carry `name=None` (the JSON schema collapsed ROM's separate keyword field) and ~15 helper sites used `getattr(x, "name", "").lower()`. Swept all match sites to the safe `(getattr(x, "name", None) or "").lower()` form across `mud/world/{obj_find,char_find}.py` and `mud/commands/{obj_manipulation,combat,misc_player,info_extended,imm_commands,imm_search,socials,remaining_rom}.py`. (commit `658d319`)

### Changed

- `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` and `docs/parity/DB_C_AUDIT.md` — added "Re-audit Triggers from In-Game Debug Pass (2026-04-30)" sections flagging `mud/loaders/json_loader.py` as a partial port of `src/db.c:load_objects` / `load_mobiles` / `fread_obj` / `fread_mobile`. The four fixed bugs all trace to the JSON-path skipping ROM normalization that the `.are` loader performs. Recommendation to downgrade the db.c "100% certified" badge or split scope deferred to next session. The data-side gap (JSON dropped ROM's separate `name`/keyword field on objects) is still unfixed.

### Added

- `mud/loaders/json_loader.py` parity audit (`docs/parity/JSON_LOADER_C_AUDIT.md`) — Phase 1–3 complete. Function inventory mapped against `src/db.c:load_objects` / `load_mobiles` / `load_rooms` / `load_resets` / `load_shops` / `fread_obj` / `fread_mobile` / `convert_mob` / `convert_obj`. **18 stable gap IDs filed (JSONLD-001..018)**: 7 CRITICAL (object keyword list missing from schema; `extra_descr` raw dicts; object `level` missing; mob hit/mana/damage tuples not populated at load; `wear_flags` raw string; `obj.affected` typed list never populated; mob `hitroll` populated from wrong JSON key — `thac0`); 8 IMPORTANT (off/imm/res/vuln int fields zero on JSON-loaded mobs; area `security`/`credits` defaults; `form`/`parts` raw strings; `race` as string not index; room `clan` not lookup-validated; D-reset semantics divergence; no per-type `value[]` coercion at load time); 3 MINOR (`short_descr`/`description` first-letter normalization; room `light` default reliance; `_link_exits_for_area` JSON-only `ROOM_NO_MOB` auto-set). The four runtime bugs fixed earlier today appear as JSONLD-001/002/003/004 — three are mitigated at consumer sites and remain ⚠️ OPEN at the loader, JSONLD-003 (`item_type`) is ✅ FIXED loader-side. `convert_mob` / `convert_obj` documented as intentionally absent (JSON files carry pre-resolved new-format values). Closures pending via `rom-gap-closer` per-gap; suggested ordering (single-commit fixes first): JSONLD-002, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 011 → then schema/converter changes for JSONLD-001, 003.

### Added

- `olc_save.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/OLC_SAVE_C_AUDIT.md`) — Phase 1–3 complete. 17 ROM functions inventoried. **JSON-authoritative framing locked**: Python writes JSON via `mud/olc/save.py` (`save_area_to_json`); `.are` remains read-only legacy input via `mud/loaders/area_loader.py`. Format-level divergences (ROM `fwrite_flag` A–Za–z encoding, `fix_string` tilde strip, `.are` column widths) are documented as N/A under this framing. 20 stable gap IDs filed (OLC_SAVE-001..020): **8 CRITICAL** round-trip data-loss bugs (mob `off`/`imm`/`res`/`vuln` flags, `form`/`parts`/`size`/`material`, mprog list, shop binding, spec_fun binding; object `level`, structured affect chain, structured extra-descr); **5 IMPORTANT** (no help-save path, `cmd_asave area` only handles `redit`, no autosave entry, NPC security gate gap, `save_area_list` missing `social.are` + HELP_AREA prepend); **7 MINOR** (4 string-drift cases, condition-letter ladder, exit lock-flag normalization, door-reset synthesis). Closures pending via `rom-gap-closer` per-gap. Tracker: `olc_save.c` row flipped ❌ Not Audited → ⚠️ Partial.

### Fixed

- `OLC_SAVE-009` — Area-grouped help-save / help-load round trip. New `_serialize_help` helper in `mud/olc/save.py` emits the canonical `{level, keywords, text}` shape; `save_area_to_json` now includes a per-area `helps` list (symmetric with mobs / objects / rooms / mob_programs / shops / specials). Paired loader-side change: new `_load_helps_from_json` in `mud/loaders/json_loader.py` walks the section, appends each entry to `area.helps`, and registers it in `help_registry` so `do help <keyword>` keeps resolving across save→reload cycles. Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:826-843` (save_helps). Closes the IMPORTANT-block hole that forced the OLC_SAVE-010 hedit dispatcher to no-op behind a "Grabando area :" placeholder. ROM `save_other_helps` standalone-help-file fan-out (`src/olc_save.c:845-872`) remains N/A under JSON-authoritative framing — Python has no global `had_list`; helps live on their owning area. Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_009_area_helps_round_trip.py` (3 cases).
- `OLC_SAVE-013` — `save_area_list` (`mud/olc/save.py`) now prepends `social.are\n` as the first line of the area.lst file, mirroring ROM `src/olc_save.c:94` (ROM OLC convention). Python omitted the prepend, causing the first area filename to appear in the position ROM reserves for the `social.are` marker. HAD/HELP_AREA standalone-help-area filename rows remain N/A pending OLC_SAVE-009 (help-save port). Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_013_area_list_social_prepend.py` (2 cases: prepend with areas present, prepend with empty registry).
- `OLC_SAVE-012` — `_is_builder` (`mud/commands/build.py`) now gates on `char.is_npc` before consulting `pcdata.security` or `area.builders`, mirroring the ROM `IS_BUILDER` macro's leading `!IS_NPC(ch)` clause (`src/merc.h`) and the `IS_NPC(ch) → sec = 0` clamp in `cmd_asave` (`src/olc_save.c:933`). Without this gate, an NPC whose name happened to appear in an area's `builders` list (or one carrying a stub `pcdata.security`) would have passed the builder check, letting mob_special-style flows bypass area security. Existing OLC test fixtures updated to set `is_npc=False` on PCs (they were relying on the missing gate). Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_012_npc_security_gate.py` (3 cases: NPC name match, NPC stub-pcdata bypass, PC regression).
- `OLC_SAVE-011` — `cmd_asave` now accepts `char=None` for the autosave-timer entry path. Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:931-936` (`if (!ch) sec = 9` lets `do_asave(NULL, "world")` persist every area). The "world" branch now skips the `_is_builder` gate when ch is None and returns silently (ROM `if (ch) send_to_char`); other args short-circuit before char-attribute access. Unblocks future autosave wiring (`olc_save.c` autosave timer port). Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_011_autosave_entry.py` (3 cases: null-ch saves every area, null-ch with empty registry no-crash, player-path message regression).
- `OLC_SAVE-010` — `@asave area` now dispatches across all five ROM editor types (aedit / redit / oedit / medit / hedit) instead of only `redit`. `cmd_asave` (`mud/commands/build.py`) now resolves the target area from `session.editor_state["area"]` for aedit, `room.area` for redit, `obj_proto.area` for oedit, and `mob_proto.area` for medit; hedit returns the ROM-faithful "Grabando area :" prefix pending OLC_SAVE-009 (help-save port). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:1080-1128`. Without this, aedit/oedit/medit users got "You are not editing an area, therefore an area vnum is required." and their changes were silently unsaveable. Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_010_asave_area_dispatch.py` (6 cases: aedit/redit/oedit/medit dispatch, hedit help-save marker, ED_NONE error).
- `OLC_SAVE-008` — Object extra-description list now routed through `_serialize_extra_descr` (`mud/olc/save.py`), which is dict-aware so a prototype carrying either a plain `{"keyword", "description"}` dict (from `mud/loaders/obj_loader.py`) or an `ExtraDescr` dataclass instance produces an identical flat payload. Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:431-435`. Replaces the prior raw `list(...extra_descr, [])` pass-through that crashed `json.dump` on dataclass values and let stray dict keys leak through. Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_008_object_extra_descr.py` (3 cases: dict round-trip, `ExtraDescr` dataclass json-safe, canonical-key shape).
- `OLC_SAVE-007` — Object affect chain now serialized through a dedicated `_serialize_affect` helper (`mud/olc/save.py`) that normalizes a prototype affect — accepting either a plain dict (A-line `{location, modifier}` or F-line `{where, location, modifier, bitvector}` per `mud/loaders/obj_loader.py`) or an `Affect` dataclass instance — into a json-safe dict. Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:399-429` (TO_OBJECT applies + TO_AFFECTS/IMMUNE/RESIST/VULN). Replaces the prior opaque `list(...affects, [])` pass-through that silently dropped fields and crashed `json.dump` on dataclass values. Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_007_object_affects.py` (5 cases: A-line dict normalization, F-line preservation, `Affect` dataclass shape, mixed-shape round-trip, `json.dump` regression).
- `OLC_SAVE-006` — Object `level` now persisted on JSON save. `_serialize_object` (`mud/olc/save.py`) emits the field; paired loader-side change in `_load_objects_from_json` (`mud/loaders/json_loader.py`) reads it back. Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:378` (save_object level emission). Without this, a save→reboot→reload cycle silently reset every object level to 0, breaking level-gated drops, identify output, and equipment loadout heuristics. Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_006_object_level.py` (3 cases: serializer field emit, full round-trip, default level=0 round-trip).
- `OLC_SAVE-005` — Mob `spec_fun` bindings now persisted on JSON save via a new top-level `specials` section emitted by `save_area_to_json` (`mud/olc/save.py`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:578-606` (save_specials writes `M <vnum> <spec_fun>` rows in the per-area `#SPECIALS` section). Loader-side `apply_specials_from_json` (`mud/loaders/specials_loader.py`) was already in place; this closure adds the missing serialize half. Without this, a save→reboot→reload cycle silently erased every spec_fun binding (e.g. `spec_breath_fire` on dragons reverted to no special). Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_005_mob_spec_fun.py` (3 cases: section emit, full round-trip, mob-without-spec_fun emits no entry).
- `OLC_SAVE-004` — Mob shop bindings (`MobIndex.pShop` → keeper / buy_types[5] / profit_buy / profit_sell / open_hour / close_hour) now persisted on JSON save via a new top-level `shops` section emitted by `save_area_to_json` (`mud/olc/save.py`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:786-824` (save_shops). Paired loader-side change: new `_load_shops_from_json` (`mud/loaders/json_loader.py`) rehydrates `mud.registry.shop_registry` keyed by keeper vnum and re-attaches `MobIndex.pShop` after mob load. Without this, a save→reboot→reload cycle silently erased every shop binding — keepers reverted to non-merchant NPCs. Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_004_mob_shops.py` (3 cases: section emit, full round-trip restoring `shop_registry`, mob-without-shop emits no entry). Loader and serializer changes ship in one commit per the audit's locked closure rule.
- `OLC_SAVE-003` — Mob `mprogs` (mob program assignments) now persisted on JSON save via a new `mob_programs` section emitted by `save_area_to_json` (`mud/olc/save.py`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:151-169` (save_mobprogs writes the per-area `#MOBPROGS` section) plus `src/olc_save.c:245-250` (per-mob MPROG_LIST inside save_mobile). Without this, a save→reboot→reload cycle silently erased every mob program binding. Python's JSON layout factors program code area-wide and links via assignments (matching `mud/loaders/json_loader.py:_load_mob_programs_from_json`); the new `_collect_mob_programs` helper reverses that projection by walking each mob's `mprogs` list and grouping by program vnum. Triggers serialize via `mud.mobprog.format_trigger_flag` (int → ROM keyword). Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_save_003_mob_mprogs.py` (3 cases: single assignment, multiple mobs sharing one program, mob without mprogs).
- `OLC_SAVE-002` — Mob `form`/`parts`/`size`/`material` now persisted by `_serialize_mobile` on JSON save (`mud/olc/save.py:136`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:213-219` (save_mobile fwrite/fwrite_flag for Form/Parts/Size/Material). Without this, a save→reload cycle silently dropped physical descriptors that drive corpse parts, magic targeting, and combat sizing. `Size` enum values are coerced to lowercase names (e.g. `Size.MEDIUM` → `"medium"`) to match the `_load_mobs_from_json` string contract. JSON-write content locked by `tests/integration/test_olc_save_002_mob_form_parts_size_material.py` (3 cases). Note: a full Python-object equality round-trip is not asserted because the loader's `merge_race_flags` unions race-default bits into `form`/`parts` on read; the JSON file itself is the canonical write surface and is asserted directly.
- `OLC_SAVE-001` — Mob defensive/offensive flag sets (`offensive`/`immune`/`resist`/`vuln` letter-strings) now persisted by `_serialize_mobile` on JSON save (`mud/olc/save.py:136`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_save.c:205-208` (save_mobile fwrite_flag for Off/Imm/Res/Vuln). Without this, a save→reboot→reload cycle silently dropped all mob defensive flag sets. Round-trip locked by `tests/integration/test_olc_save_001_mob_defensive_flags.py` (3 cases: serializer field emission, full save→load round-trip, empty/zero flag-string safety).
- `OLC_ACT-014` — Locked the `area.changed = True` protocol divergence between Python and ROM. ROM `src/olc.c:452-463`/`:510-521` dispatchers `SET_BIT(pArea->area_flags, AREA_CHANGED)` whenever a subcommand handler returns `TRUE`; Python uses an imperative pattern where each `_interpret_*edit` branch sets `area.changed = True` directly after a successful mutation. Structural divergence with equivalent behavior. Added a ROM-cite comment to `_mark_area_changed` (`mud/commands/build.py:220`) and a regression test that exercises one representative `name` mutation per editor (aedit/redit/oedit/medit), one secondary subcommand (aedit `security`), and one failed-mutation no-op case mirroring ROM's "handler returned FALSE → no SET_BIT" path. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_014_area_changed_protocol.py` (6 cases).
- `OLC_ACT-013` — Locked the equivalence between Python `_get_area_for_vnum` (`mud/commands/build.py:1352`) and ROM `get_vnum_area` (`src/olc_act.c:588-599`). ROM walks the `area_first` linked list; Python iterates `area_registry.values()`. CPython dicts preserve insertion order (3.7+), so load-order traversal is equivalent to ROM's linked-list walk. Added a ROM-cite comment to the function and a regression test that locks the dict insertion-order guarantee plus first-match-on-overlap behavior. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_013_get_area_for_vnum_order.py` (3 cases).

### Added

- `OLC-016` / `OLC-017` / `OLC-018` / `OLC-019` — sibling-audit dispatcher gaps closed transitively by OLC_ACT-001/002/003/004/005/006. The OLC-NNN gaps were filed in `OLC_C_AUDIT.md` as "missing dispatcher subcommand" entries; the OLC_ACT-NNN gaps are the corresponding builder-logic closures in `src/olc_act.c`. In Python, the dispatcher and builder live in the same `cmd_*edit` function in `mud/commands/build.py`, so closing the OLC_ACT side automatically closes the OLC side. All four CRITICAL `do_*edit create` paths are now wired with full ROM validation chains and authoritative `new_*_index` defaults from `src/mem.c`.
- `OLC_ACT-002` + `OLC_ACT-003` + `OLC_ACT-004` — `redit create <vnum>` / `redit reset` / `redit <vnum>` silent teleport (`mud/commands/build.py:cmd_redit`). All three are branches of ROM's single `do_redit` function (`src/olc.c:745-821`) so they ship in one combined commit. **OLC_ACT-002**: explicit `redit create <vnum>` keyword wired with full ROM validation chain (vnum required, area assignment, IS_BUILDER, already-exists). `new_room_index` defaults from `src/mem.c:181-218` (heal_rate=100, mana_rate=100). After create, builder is moved into the new room via silent `_char_from_room`/`_char_to_room`. **OLC_ACT-003**: `redit reset` dispatcher wired — security gate, exact ROM message "Room reset.\\n\\r", area `changed=True`, calls `apply_resets(area)` via `_apply_resets_for_redit` wrapper. ROM uses `reset_room(pRoom)` (src/olc.c:765); Python's broader-scope `apply_resets(area)` is a documented minor divergence pending a per-room reset port. **OLC_ACT-004**: `redit <vnum>` silent-teleport reuses existing `_char_from_room`/`_char_to_room` primitives from `mud.commands.imm_commands` per the locked human-decision flag — no new movement infra. Validates target room exists, IS_BUILDER on TARGET area, relocates, sets descriptor edit pointer. Unblocks OLC-017 (all three halves: create/reset/vnum). Tests: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_002_redit_create.py` (8), `tests/integration/test_olc_act_003_redit_reset.py` (4), `tests/integration/test_olc_act_004_redit_vnum_teleport.py` (5).
- `OLC_ACT-006` — `medit create <vnum>` subcommand (`mud/commands/build.py:_medit_create`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_act.c:3704-3753` plus `new_mob_index` defaults from `src/mem.c:365-424` (player_name="no name", short_descr="(no short description)", long_descr="(no long description)\\n\\r", description="", level=0, sex=Sex.NONE, size=Size.MEDIUM, start_pos="standing", default_pos="standing", material="unknown", new_format=True). **CRITICAL**: `ActFlag.IS_NPC` is set on both `act_flags` (modern) and legacy `act` per ROM `src/olc_act.c:3745` `pMob->act = ACT_IS_NPC;` — without this, every NPC-classification check downstream would misclassify newly-built mobs as players. Full ROM validation chain (vnum required, area assignment, builder security, already-exists). Removed pre-existing auto-create-on-unknown-vnum bug. Unblocks OLC-019. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_006_medit_create.py` (12 cases). Drive-by: `tests/integration/test_olc_builders.py:test_mob_proto` fixture also patched to write to the canonical `mud.models.mob.mob_registry` (matching the OLC_ACT-005 obj-fixture fix).
- `OLC_ACT-005` — `oedit create <vnum>` subcommand (`mud/commands/build.py:_oedit_create`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_act.c:3178-3225` plus `new_obj_index` defaults from `src/mem.c:297-335` (name="no name", short_descr="(no short description)", description="(no description)", item_type="trash", material="unknown", extra_flags=0, wear_flags=0, weight=0, cost=0, value=[0]*5, new_format=True). Full ROM validation chain: vnum required (empty/zero rejected with "Syntax:  oedit create [vnum]"), area assignment ("OEdit:  That vnum is not assigned an area."), builder security ("OEdit:  Vnum in an area you cannot build in."), already-exists ("OEdit:  Object vnum already exists."). Returns "Object Created.\n\r" on success. **Removed** the pre-existing auto-create-on-unknown-vnum bug — unknown vnums without the explicit `create` keyword now return an error instead of silently allocating a new proto. Unblocks OLC-018. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_005_oedit_create.py` (11 cases). Drive-by: fixed `tests/integration/test_olc_builders.py:test_obj_proto` fixture which registered protos in the wrong registry (`mud.registry.obj_registry` vs the canonical `mud.models.obj.obj_index_registry`).
- `OLC_ACT-001` — `aedit create` subcommand (`mud/commands/build.py:cmd_aedit` + `_aedit_create`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_act.c:667-679` plus authoritative defaults from `src/mem.c:91-122` (`new_area`): `name="New area"`, `builders="None"`, `security=1`, `min/max_vnum=0`, `empty=True`, `area_flags=AreaFlag.ADDED`, `file_name="area<vnum>.are"`. Vnum allocation uses `max(area_registry) + 1` (Python adaptation; ROM uses global `top_area` counter). Reachable from both `@aedit create` (no active session) and `create` typed inside an active aedit session. Unblocks OLC-016 in the sibling audit. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_001_aedit_create.py` (9 cases).
- `olc_act.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/OLC_ACT_C_AUDIT.md`) — Phase 1–3 complete. 108 ROM functions inventoried across four editors (aedit/redit/oedit/medit); mpedit/hedit out of scope (sibling audits). 14 stable gap IDs filed (OLC_ACT-001..014): 6 CRITICAL (aedit_create wholly missing; redit_create missing; redit reset/vnum dispatcher gaps; oedit_create missing security gate; medit_create missing ACT_IS_NPC flag on new mobs), 6 IMPORTANT (show-command completeness for all four editors; success message string drift; aedit_reset missing), 2 MINOR (structural). Tier breakdown: TIER A 9 functions (line-by-line), TIER B 8 functions (moderate), TIER C ~78 functions (inventory). Closures pending via `rom-gap-closer` per-gap. Tracker: olc_act.c row flipped ❌ Not Audited → ⚠️ Partial.

### Fixed

- `OLC_ACT-007` — `aedit show` now includes the area flags row (mirroring ROM `src/olc_act.c:644-646`). The Flags line uses `flag_string(AreaFlag, area.area_flags)` to format the ADDED/CHANGED/LOADING flags. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_007_aedit_show_flags.py` (5 cases).
- `OLC_ACT-008` — `redit show` brought to ROM byte-parity with `src/olc_act.c:1068-1236`. Sector display labels in `_SECTOR_NAMES` (`mud/commands/build.py`) now use `swim`/`noswim` per ROM `src/tables.c:391-392` (previously `water_swim`/`water_noswim`); the exit line in `_room_summary` now emits the two-space gap between `Key: [%5d]` and `Exit flags:` per ROM lines 1184/1196 (single sprintf trailing space + strcat leading space). The remaining ROM fields (description, name, area, vnum, room flags, heal/mana/clan/owner/extra-descs, characters, objects, per-exit keyword/description, uppercase-non-reset flag rule) were already implemented in `_room_summary`; the new parity tests lock them in going forward. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_008_redit_show_parity.py` (4 cases).
- `OLC_ACT-010` — `medit show` rewritten to ROM byte layout (`src/olc_act.c:3519-3699`). Now emits all ROM rows in order: Name/Area, Act flags, Vnum/Sex/Race, Level/Align/Hitroll/DamType, conditional Group, Hit/Damage/Mana dice, Affected by, Armor (4 columns), Form, Parts, Imm, Res, Vuln, Off, Size, Material, Start/Default pos, Wealth, Short/Long/Description. New helpers `_format_intflag`/`_format_position`/`_format_size`/`_format_sex` in `mud/commands/build.py`. Three sub-gaps explicitly deferred and recorded in `docs/parity/OLC_ACT_C_AUDIT.md`: **OLC_ACT-010b** dice/AC byte format (Python data model stores strings; ROM stores 3 ints per dice); **OLC_ACT-010c** shop/mprogs/spec_fun rendering (needs MobShop/MProg model alignment + `spec_name` lookup); **OLC_ACT-010d** ROM-faithful flag-table name strings (display tables analogous to OLC_ACT-009's `_WEAR_FLAG_DISPLAY`/`_EXTRA_FLAG_DISPLAY` needed for 10 mob flag tables). Existing `tests/test_olc_medit.py::test_medit_show_command` assertions updated to ROM format. New: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_010_medit_show_parity.py` (8 cases).
- `OLC_ACT-012` — `aedit reset` subcommand wired in `_interpret_aedit` (`mud/commands/build.py`). Mirrors ROM `src/olc_act.c:653-663` `aedit_reset`: calls `apply_resets(area)` via the existing `_apply_resets_for_redit` wrapper, sets `area.changed=True`, returns ROM-exact `"Area reset."` (previously `"Unknown area editor command: reset"`). Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_012_aedit_reset.py` (1 case).
- `OLC_ACT-011` — All four `*_name` OLC builders (`aedit_name`, `redit_name`, `oedit_name`, `medit_name`) now return ROM's exact `"Name set."` success message (was Python-verbose "Area name set to: X" / "Room name set to X" / "Object name (keywords) set to: X" / "Player name set to: X"). ROM source: `src/olc_act.c:683-700`/`1770-1787`/`2990-3010`/`3913-3931`. Existing assertions in `tests/test_olc_aedit.py` / `test_olc_medit.py` / `test_olc_oedit.py` updated. New: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_011_name_messages.py` (4 cases).
- `OLC_ACT-009` — `oedit show` rewritten to ROM byte layout (`src/olc_act.c:2733-2812`) + `_show_obj_values` ported from ROM `show_obj_values` (`src/olc_act.c:2210-2374`). New display tables `_WEAR_FLAG_DISPLAY` / `_EXTRA_FLAG_DISPLAY` mirror `src/tables.c:434-483` byte-for-byte (ROM-faithful labels: "finger"/"nosac"/"wearfloat"/"antigood"/"rotdeath" — not Python enum-name forms). New `_APPLY_NAMES` dict mirrors `src/merc.h:1205-1231` + `src/tables.c:489-516` for the affects table (with the ROM `APPLY_SAVES`/`APPLY_SAVING_PARA` 20-collision resolved to "saves"). `_show_obj_values` covers 13 ITEM_* cases (LIGHT, WAND/STAFF, PORTAL, FURNITURE, SCROLL/POTION/PILL, ARMOR, WEAPON, CONTAINER, DRINK_CON, FOUNTAIN, FOOD, MONEY); WAND/STAFF/SCROLL/POTION/PILL spell-name lookup emits raw value-index until a skill-by-index registry lands. Existing `tests/test_olc_oedit.py::test_oedit_show_command` assertions updated from Python-only verbose labels to ROM format. New: `tests/integration/test_olc_act_009_oedit_show_parity.py` (8 cases).
- `OLC-022` — `do_resets` (`mud/commands/imm_olc.py`) rewritten with full ROM subcommand set (src/olc.c:1232-1469): P-reset via `inside <containerVnum> [limit] [count]` (validates ITEM_CONTAINER or ITEM_CORPSE_NPC), O-reset via `room`, G/E-reset via wear-loc prefix lookup (`lfin` → FINGER_L), R-reset via `random 1..6`, M-reset extended with optional `[max#area] [max#room]` args. 6-line syntax block on unrecognized numeric-arg subcommand. `_add_reset` helper extracted. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_do_resets_subcommands.py` (27 cases).
- `OLC-020` — `display_resets` (`mud/commands/imm_olc.py`) now faithfully formats each reset type (M/O/P/G/E/D/R) with exact ROM `sprintf` column widths, pet-shop `final[5]='P'` overlay (src/olc.c:1037-1044), wear-loc decoding via `wear_loc_strings` table, and door-reset state decoding. Bad-mob/obj `continue` paths correctly suppress output per ROM. New `mud/utils/olc_tables.py` provides `WEAR_LOC_STRINGS`, `WEAR_LOC_FLAGS`, `DOOR_RESETS`, `DIR_NAMES` tables ported from `src/tables.c:355-572`. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_display_resets.py` (16 cases).
- `OLC-023` — `do_alist` (`mud/commands/imm_olc.py:121-146`) iterated the nonexistent `registry.areas` attribute and returned a header-only listing on a live system. Now iterates `area_registry.values()`, prints `area.vnum` (was a 1-indexed enumerate counter — drifted from ROM `src/olc.c:1494`'s `pArea->vnum`), and reads `area.file_name` (was the nonexistent `area.filename`). Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_alist.py` (4 cases).

### Added

- `STRING-004` — `string_add` OLC editor input dispatcher (.c/.s/.r/.f/.h/.ld/.li/.lr dot-commands, ~/@ termination with on_commit callback, MAX_STRING_LENGTH-4 length cap) (src/string.c:121). 24 integration tests in `tests/integration/test_string_editor_string_add.py`. Completes `string.c` at 100%.
- `STRING-005` — `format_string` word-wrap, sentence capitalization (src/string.c:299).
- `STRING-002` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_append(string_edit_obj, current) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:66-86`: enter APPEND mode, preserve the buffer, and return the editor banner (4 lines) plus the `numlines()` line-numbered listing. Takes a `StringEdit` object and a *current* string (the existing text to append to), unlike `string_edit` which clears. The banner matches ROM verbatim: `-=======- Entering APPEND Mode -========-`, help, termination, and separator. The listing shows each line with its 1-indexed line number in `%2d` format. Used by every OLC description builder (`aedit_builder`, `redit`, `medit`, `oedit`, etc.). Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_append.py` (9 cases).
- `STRING-001` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_edit(string_edit_obj) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:38-57`: enter EDIT mode, clear the buffer, return the editor banner (4 lines). Takes a `StringEdit` object (mirrors ROM `ch->desc->pString` field) and initializes it with an empty buffer. The returned banner matches ROM verbatim: `-========- Entering EDIT Mode -=========-`, help prompt, termination instructions, and separator. Used by `olc_act.c::aedit_builder` ("desc edit"), `redit` (edit-description), `medit` (edit-description). Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_edit.py` (6 cases).
- `STRING-003` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_replace(orig, old, new) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:95-112`: replace the first occurrence of *old* substring within *orig* with *new*. If *old* is not found, returns *orig* unchanged. Empty *old* returns *orig* unchanged (ROM behavior). Used by `string_add::.r` dot-command (STRING-004) and `aedit_builder::replace`. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_replace.py` (9 cases).
- `STRING-010` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_lineadd(string, newstr, line) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:607-645`: insert *newstr* as the 1-indexed line N. The inserted line gets a `\n\r` suffix. If line is past the end, insertion doesn't happen (never reached). Used by `.li` and `.lr` dot-commands. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_lineadd.py` (10 cases).
- `STRING-009` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_linedel(string, line) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:574-605`: remove the 1-indexed line N from the string, preserving `\n\r` line endings. Out-of-range line numbers are a no-op. Used by `.ld` dot-command. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_linedel.py` (8 cases).
- `STRING-012` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:numlines(string) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:676-692`: format string as line-numbered listing (`%2d. <line>\n\r`), 1-indexed. Used by `.s` dot-command and `string_append` greeting. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_numlines.py` (7 cases).
- `STRING-011` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:merc_getline(string) -> tuple[str, str]`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:647-674`: read one `\n`-terminated line; consume trailing `\r` when present (ROM `\n\r` canonical line ending). Returns `(rest, line)`. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_merc_getline.py` (6 cases).
- `STRING-006` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:first_arg(argument, lower=False) -> tuple[str, str]`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:468-508`: quote/paren-aware single-arg parser. Recognizes `'`/`"`/`%` (self-pair quotes) and `(`/`)` (balanced pair). Unterminated quotes consume the entire remainder. The `lower` flag (ROM `fCase`) lowercases the parsed word. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_first_arg.py` (10 cases).
- `STRING-008` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_proper(argument) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:551-572`: uppercases first char of each space-delimited word, leaves rest of each word as-is. Differs from Python `str.title()` which also lowercases the rest. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_proper.py` (8 cases).
- `STRING-007` — `mud/utils/string_editor.py:string_unpad(argument) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/string.c:516-543`: trims leading/trailing spaces (only spaces, not all whitespace) — `aedit_builder` callers expect tab/newline preservation. Test: `tests/integration/test_string_editor_unpad.py` (7 cases).
- `BIT-003` — `mud/utils/bit.py:is_stat(table) -> bool`. Mirrors ROM `src/bit.c:93-104` (and replaces ROM's static `flag_stat_table[]` registry at `src/bit.c:50-83`): returns True for IntEnum (stat) tables, False for IntFlag (flag) tables. The Python port encodes the stat-vs-flag distinction in the type system, so no runtime registry is needed. With BIT-001/002/003 closed, `bit.c` flips ✅ Audited 90% → ✅ Audited 100%. Test: `tests/integration/test_bit_is_stat.py` (5 cases).
- `BIT-002` — `mud/utils/bit.py:flag_string(table, bits) -> str`. Mirrors ROM `src/bit.c:151-177`: returns a space-joined string of every flag name set in *bits* for IntFlag (flag) tables, the single matched name for IntEnum (stat) tables, or the literal `"none"` when nothing matched. The ROM rotating two-buffer trick (`buf[2][512]`) is unnecessary in Python (immutable strings). Composite alias IntFlag members are skipped to avoid double-printing. Test: `tests/integration/test_bit_flag_string.py` (8 cases).
- `BIT-001` — `mud/utils/bit.py:flag_value(table, argument) -> int | None`. Mirrors ROM `src/bit.c:111-142`: tokenizes the argument, prefix-looks up each token, OR-accumulates hits for IntFlag (flag) tables, returns a single matched value for IntEnum (stat) tables, returns `None` (the `NO_FLAG` sentinel) on no match. Unknown tokens are silently skipped, mirroring ROM `flag_value` semantics (which differ from ROM `do_flag` on purpose). Test: `tests/integration/test_bit_flag_value.py` (9 cases).
- `OLC-INFRA-001` — descriptor-level OLC editor state plumbing. New `mud/olc/editor_state.py` provides `EditorMode` IntEnum (mirrors ROM `src/olc.h:53-59` — `NONE`/`AREA`/`ROOM`/`OBJECT`/`MOBILE`/`MPCODE`/`HELP`), `StringEdit` dataclass (mirrors ROM `desc->pString` — buffer + on-commit hook + `MAX_STRING_EDIT_LENGTH=4604`), and `route_descriptor_input(session)` (mirrors ROM `src/comm.c:833-847` — `string_edit` precedes `editor_mode` precedes normal interpret). `Session.editor_mode` and `Session.string_edit` fields wired in `mud/net/session.py`. Destinations (`string_add` for STRING-004, `run_olc_editor` for OLC-001) remain stubbed under their own gap IDs; this commit lands only the routing decision and data shapes that unblock the STRING-001..012 cluster. Test: `tests/integration/test_olc_descriptor_state.py` (6 cases).

### Changed

- `string.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/STRING_C_AUDIT.md`) — `string.c` flipped ⚠️ Partial 85% (stale, wrong file path) → ✅ Audited 5% (accurate). Phase 1 inventory catalogues all 12 public functions (`string_edit`, `string_append`, `string_replace`, `string_add`, `format_string`, `first_arg`, `string_unpad`, `string_proper`, `string_linedel`, `string_lineadd`, `merc_getline`, `numlines`); every one is OLC-editor backend operating on `ch->desc->pString`/`ch->desc->editor` with no current Python consumer (`mud/olc/` skeleton only). 12 stable gap IDs filed (`STRING-001..STRING-012`), all DEFERRED to the OLC audit cluster (`olc.c`/`olc_act.c`/`olc_save.c`/`olc_mpcode.c`/`hedit.c`) where their first concrete consumers will appear. Previous tracker note "85% — `mud/utils.py`" was stale: that file does not exist; only `mud/utils/text.py:smash_tilde` (a `merc.h` helper, not a `string.c` helper) is ported. No code changes.
- `const.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/CONST_C_AUDIT.md`) — Phase 1–3 complete. 16 ROM data tables inventoried; 13 ✅ AUDITED (item, wiznet, attack, race, pc_race, class, int_app, liq, skill, group, plus `str_app.carry` + `str_app.wield` columns); 7 stable gap IDs filed (`CONST-001`..`CONST-007`). **Four CRITICAL combat-math gaps surfaced**: `CONST-002` `GET_HITROLL` macro missing `str_app[STR].tohit` (`mud/combat/engine.py:411,420`), `CONST-003` `GET_DAMROLL` missing `str_app[STR].todam` (`mud/combat/engine.py:1184`), `CONST-004` `GET_AC` missing `dex_app[DEX].defensive` (`mud/combat/engine.py:391`), `CONST-005` `advance_level` missing `con_app[CON].hitp` + `number_range(hp_min,hp_max)` per-level HP roll (`mud/advancement.py:91`). One IMPORTANT advancement gap (`CONST-006` `wis_app[WIS].practice` in `advance_level`). One IMPORTANT data gap (`CONST-001` `title_table` 480 entries — defer to NANNY-009 dedicated session). One MINOR (`CONST-007` `weapon_table` — defer to OLC audit, BIT-style). `ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` row updated; tracker held at ⚠️ Partial 80% pending closures via `/rom-gap-closer`. No code changes.
- `bit.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/BIT_C_AUDIT.md`) — `bit.c` flipped ⚠️ Partial 90% → ✅ Audited 90%. Confirmed the only current Python consumer of bit.c-shaped logic (`do_flag` in `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py`) faithfully mirrors ROM `do_flag` semantics (not ROM `flag_value` — they differ on unknown-name handling on purpose). Three MINOR helpers (`flag_value`, `flag_string`, `flag_stat_table`+`is_stat`) recorded as `BIT-001`/`BIT-002`/`BIT-003` and deferred to the OLC audit, where their first concrete consumers (`olc.c`, `olc_act.c`, `olc_save.c`, `act_olc.c`) will appear. No code changes.
- `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` — reconciled the stale `P1-3: db.c + db2.c (PARTIAL - 55%)` section with the actual audit state. Both files have been ✅ Audited 100% on the summary table since the Jan 5 (db.c) and Apr 28 (db2.c) sessions; the P1-3 narrative section has been rewritten to reflect that and to point at the per-file audit docs (`DB_C_AUDIT.md` covers db.c's 44/44 functional functions; `DB2_C_AUDIT.md` covers DB2-001/002/003/006 closures and DB2-004/005 deferred MINORs). No code changes.

### Added

- `comm.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/COMM_C_AUDIT.md`) — non-networking surface of `src/comm.c` (`bust_a_prompt`, `act_new`, `colour`, `check_parse_name`, `stop_idling`, `fix_sex`, `show_string`) mapped to Python equivalents. Networking layer (`main`, `init_socket`, `game_loop_*`, descriptor I/O) confirmed deferred-by-design per the asyncio rewrite. Phase 3 produces 9 stable gap IDs (`COMM-001..COMM-009`).
- `mud/utils/prompt.py:bust_a_prompt(char) -> str` — port of ROM `src/comm.c:1420-1595`. Expands `%h %H %m %M %v %V %x %X %g %s %a %r %R %z %% %e %c %o %O` against character state, falls back to `<%dhp %dm %dmv> %s` when `ch->prompt` is unset, short-circuits to `<AFK>` when `COMM_AFK` is on. Wired into both telnet game-loop call sites in `mud/net/connection.py`. Test: `tests/integration/test_prompt_rom_parity.py` (8 cases).
- `board.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/BOARD_C_AUDIT.md`) — full Phase 1 inventory of every public ROM function in `src/board.c` (Erwin Andreasen 1995–96 note-board subsystem) mapped to `mud/notes.py`, `mud/models/board.py`, and `mud/commands/notes.py`. Phase 3 produces 14 stable gap IDs (BOARD-001..BOARD-014); `tracker.md` flips `board.c` from ❌ Not Audited 35% → ⚠️ Partial 85%. New regression suite `tests/integration/test_boards_rom_parity.py` (6 ROM-parity tests, all green).

### Added

- `MUSIC-002` — `mud/music/__init__.py:load_songs(path=area/music.txt)` ports ROM `src/music.c:160-218`. Reads the ROM-format music data file (`group~` / `name~` / lyric lines / `~` / `#`), populates `mud.music.song_table` (up to `MAX_SONGS=20`), resets `channel_songs[0..MAX_GLOBAL]` to `-1`, drops lyrics past `MAX_LINES=100` with a warning, and gracefully no-ops on a missing file. Wired into `mud/world/world_state.py:initialize_world` so the song table is populated at boot — the global "MUSIC:" channel and `play list` previously had nothing to broadcast or display. Tests: `tests/integration/test_music_load_songs.py` (3 cases).

### Fixed

- `CONST-006` — `advance_level` per-level practice gain now applies `wis_app[get_curr_stat(ch, STAT_WIS)].practice`, mirroring ROM `src/update.c:87`. Previously the gain was a hardcoded `PRACTICES_PER_LEVEL = 2` constant — WIS-3 dunce was getting 2 free practices/level instead of 0; WIS-13 default got 2 instead of 1; WIS-25 sage got 2 instead of 5. New `mud/math/stat_apps.py::WIS_APP` table (verbatim port of `src/const.c:790-817`) and `wis_practice_bonus(ch)` accessor. The level-up message now reflects the actual roll with correct singular/plural pluralisation. Per AGENTS.md "test asserting behavior that contradicts ROM is a bug in the test", five existing tests in `tests/test_advancement.py` and `tests/integration/test_character_advancement.py` that asserted the old constant gain were updated to assert ROM's wis_app formula. Test: `tests/integration/test_advancement_wis_app.py` (26 cases).
- `CONST-005` — `advance_level` per-level HP gain now follows ROM `src/update.c:74-79` exactly: `UMAX(2, (con_app[get_curr_stat(ch, STAT_CON)].hitp + number_range(class_table[ch->class].hp_min, class_table[ch->class].hp_max)) * 9 / 10)`. Previously used a static `LEVEL_BONUS[ch_class]` dict (`mud/advancement.py:91`) — both the RNG roll and the CON modifier were absent, so a CON-25 character was missing +8 hitp/level and a CON-3 character was missing −2 hitp/level on top of the missing variability. New `mud/math/stat_apps.py::CON_APP` table (verbatim port of `src/const.c:850-878`) and `con_hitp_bonus(ch)` accessor. Mana/move continue to use the legacy `LEVEL_BONUS` path until their respective gaps close. Per AGENTS.md "test asserting behavior that contradicts ROM is a bug in the test", six existing tests in `tests/test_advancement.py` and `tests/integration/test_character_advancement.py` that asserted the old static HP values were updated to seed `rng_mm.number_range` and assert the ROM formula. Test: `tests/integration/test_advancement_con_app.py` (14 cases).
- `CONST-004` — Armor class now augments `armor[type]` with `dex_app[get_curr_stat(ch, STAT_DEX)].defensive` when the character `IS_AWAKE` (`position > POS_SLEEPING`), mirroring ROM `src/merc.h:2104-2106`. New `mud/math/stat_apps.py::DEX_APP` table (verbatim from `src/const.c:821-848`) and `get_ac(ch, ac_type)` accessor; combat at `mud/combat/engine.py:391`, `do_score` at `mud/commands/session.py`, and the wiz `stat char` AC line at `mud/commands/imm_search.py` all read through it. Sleeping/stunned/incap/dead victims still show raw armor (the IS_AWAKE gate). Before this fix, a DEX-3 character was missing +40 AC penalty and a DEX-25 character was missing −120 AC bonus on every combat hit-roll and every AC display. Test: `tests/integration/test_combat_dex_app.py` (11 cases).
- `CONST-003` — Combat `GET_DAMROLL` now augments `ch->damroll` with `str_app[get_curr_stat(ch, STAT_STR)].todam`, mirroring ROM `src/merc.h:2109-2110` (consumed at `src/fight.c:588` for weapon damage). New `mud/math/stat_apps.py::get_damroll(ch)` accessor; `calculate_weapon_damage` at `mud/combat/engine.py:1189` now reads it. Before this fix, a STR-3 attacker missed −1 damage and a STR-25 attacker missed +9 damage. Test: `tests/integration/test_combat_str_app.py::test_get_damroll_*` (7 cases).
- `CONST-002` — Combat `GET_HITROLL` now augments `ch->hitroll` with `str_app[get_curr_stat(ch, STAT_STR)].tohit`, mirroring ROM `src/merc.h:2107-2108` (consumed at `src/fight.c:471` for THAC0). New module `mud/math/stat_apps.py` ports `STR_APP[26]` verbatim from `src/const.c:728-755` and exposes `get_hitroll(ch)`; both attack paths in `mud/combat/engine.py` (THAC0 at L411, percent fallback at L420) now read the augmented value. Before this fix, a STR-3 attacker missed −3 to-hit and a STR-25 attacker missed +6. Test: `tests/integration/test_combat_str_app.py` (8 cases).
- `MUSIC-004` — `mud/commands/player_info.py:do_play` jukebox scan now applies `mud.world.vision.can_see_object(ch, obj)` so invisible / VIS_DEATH / dark-room jukeboxes drop out of selection, mirroring ROM `src/music.c:229-232`'s `can_see_obj(ch, juke)` filter. Test: `tests/integration/test_music_play.py::test_do_play_skips_invisible_jukebox`.

- `MUSIC-003` — `play list` in `mud/commands/player_info.py:do_play` now reads `mud.music.song_table` (previously `mud.registry.song_table`, which doesn't exist, so it always fell through to a 3-song hardcoded stub). Reproduces ROM `src/music.c:246-292`: capitalized `"<short_descr> has the following songs available:"` header, `play list <prefix>` filters song names by case-insensitive prefix in two `%-35s` columns, `play list artist [<prefix>]` filters by group name in single-line `%-39s %-39s` group/name pairs, and a trailing odd column is flushed on its own line. Tests: `tests/integration/test_music_play.py` (4 new list-formatting cases).

- `MUSIC-001` — `mud/commands/player_info.py:do_play` now ports the queueing half of ROM `src/music.c:220-354`. Previously a stub: it found a jukebox, returned `"Coming right up."`, and queued nothing — so `song_update()` had nothing to broadcast and `play loud` was silently ignored. The port now resolves the `loud` keyword for global plays, enforces the `value[4] > -1` / `channel_songs[MAX_GLOBAL] > -1` queue-full check (`"The jukebox is full up right now."`), case-insensitive name-prefix matches against `mud.music.song_table`, surfaces `"That song isn't available."` on no match, and writes the song id into the first free `juke.value[1..4]` (local) or `channel_songs[1..MAX_GLOBAL]` (global) slot — also resetting the slot-0 line cursor to `-1` when slot 1 is filled, matching ROM `src/music.c:337-352`. Tests: `tests/integration/test_music_play.py` (7 cases).

- `NANNY-008` — `broadcast_entry_to_room` (`mud/net/connection.py`) now moves `char.pet` into the owner's room via `char_to_room` and emits a TO_ROOM "$n has entered the game." for the pet on login, mirroring ROM `src/nanny.c:810-815`. Previously a returning player's pet stayed un-roomed and onlookers never saw the pet's arrival. Test: `tests/integration/test_nanny_login_parity.py::test_login_pet_follows_owner_into_room`.
- `COMM-009` — Standalone `mud/utils/fix_sex.py:fix_sex(ch)` helper added, mirroring ROM `src/comm.c:2178-2182`: clamps `ch.sex` to `[0,2]`, falling back to `pcdata.true_sex` for PCs and `0` for NPCs. Inline clamp at the affect-strip site in `mud/handler.py:1110-1112` now delegates to the helper. Test: `tests/test_fix_sex.py` (5 cases).
- `COMM-008` — ANSI translator now covers ROM `colour()` specials at `src/comm.c:2714-2728`: `{D` → `\x1b[1;30m`, `{*` → `\x07` (bell), `{/` → `\n\r`, `{-` → `~`, `{{` → `{`. `mud/net/ansi.py` rewritten as a single-pass `re.sub` so `{{` cannot be re-matched as `{h` once partially consumed; `strip_ansi` mirrors ROM `send_to_char` non-colour branch (`src/comm.c:1995-2007`) by eating both characters of any `{X` pair. Tests: `tests/test_ansi.py::test_translate_ansi_handles_rom_specials` and `::test_strip_ansi_eats_rom_token_pairs`.
- `COMM-007` — `_stop_idling` now broadcasts the ROM "$n has returned from the void." message through `mud/utils/act.py:act_format`, mirroring ROM `act(...)` at `src/comm.c:1922`. The previous literal `f"{name} has returned from the void."` fallback rendered "Someone has returned…" for entities without a `name`; with the new act_format pipeline, `$n` expands via `_pers` (name → short_descr fallback). Test: `tests/test_networking_telnet.py::test_stop_idling_broadcast_uses_rom_act_format`.
- `COMM-002` — `show_string` pager input semantics now match ROM. While paging, `_read_player_command` (`mud/net/connection.py`) used to treat `"c"` as continue and dispatch arbitrary non-empty input to `interpret()`. ROM `src/comm.c:632-633` instead routes input to `show_string` instead of `interpret`, and `show_string` at `src/comm.c:2131-2141` aborts on any non-empty input and consumes it as no-op. Fix: empty input continues paging; any non-empty input clears the pager and returns `" "` (no-op). The bulk paging machinery (`Session.start_paging` / `send_next_page`) was already wired through `mud/net/protocol.py:send_to_char`; this closure pinned the missing ROM-faithful abort semantics. Tests: `tests/test_networking_telnet.py::test_show_string_pager_aborts_on_any_non_empty_input_per_rom` (new) and `test_show_string_paginates_output` (updated to assert `" "` no-op consumption).
- `COMM-006` — `is_valid_character_name` now rejects names matching any clan in `CLAN_TABLE` (case-insensitive), mirroring ROM `src/comm.c:1713-1718`. `rom`/`ROM` and `loner` are both rejected at character creation.
- `COMM-004` — Character-creation name validator now rejects names that collide with any mob prototype's `player_name` keyword list, mirroring ROM `src/comm.c:1782-1796`. Implemented as a new `mud.account.is_valid_character_name` helper layered on top of `is_valid_account_name`; the old syntactic-only validator stays intact for account-name validation (a Python addition with no ROM analogue). `create_character` and the connection-layer character-creation flow both use the new validator. Pre-existing tests in `tests/test_account_auth.py` that used stock RPG names colliding with real mobs (`Zeus`, `Nomad`, `Queen`, `Guardian`) were renamed to invented tokens — per AGENTS.md "test contradicting ROM C is a bug in the test."
- `COMM-003` — `check_parse_name` length floor now matches ROM. `is_valid_account_name` rejected names shorter than 3 characters; ROM `src/comm.c:1729` rejects only names shorter than 2. Two-letter ROM-legal names (e.g. `Bo`) are now accepted. The previous NANNY-012 test (`test_name_validator_matches_rom_check_parse_name`) had locked in the buggy `< 3` threshold with a docstring misreading ROM — the test now asserts the correct ROM `< 2` bound (`Bo` accepted, `a` rejected).
- `COMM-001` — Player prompts now render character state. The telnet game loop previously emitted a literal `"> "` regardless of `do_prompt` settings; HP / mana / move / room / alignment never reached the client. Fix: replaced the hard-coded `send_prompt("> ")` with `send_prompt(bust_a_prompt(char))` at `mud/net/connection.py:1698,1923` and made `do_prompt` write to `Character.prompt` (mirrors ROM `ch->prompt`, `src/act_info.c:951-952`) instead of `PCData.prompt` (which in ROM is the colour triplet, not the format string). `send_prompt` now applies ANSI rendering so `{p…{x` colour wrappers don't leak as raw text. Five existing tests in `test_player_prompt.py` / `test_player_auto_settings.py` / `test_config_commands.py` updated to assert the correct field (per AGENTS.md "test contradicting ROM C is a bug in the test").
- `BOARD-001` — Five hardcoded ROM boards (General/Ideas/Announce/Bugs/Personal) are now seeded on `load_boards()` with the exact ROM levels, force-types, default recipients, and purge-days from `src/board.c:67-76`. Persisted JSON content is overlaid on top so notes survive a reload but the static metadata cannot drift below ROM defaults.
- `BOARD-002` / `BOARD-003` — `note write` and `note send` now emit ROM TO_ROOM `act()` broadcasts ("$n starts writing a note." / "$n finishes $s note.") via `char.room.broadcast(..., exclude=char)`, mirroring `src/board.c:503` and `src/board.c:1181`. Adds `_possessive(char)` helper for ROM `$s` (his/her/its from `Character.sex`).
- `BOARD-004` — `Board.post` now routes through a new `mud.notes.next_note_stamp(base)` helper backed by a module-level `_last_note_stamp` counter, mirroring ROM `finish_note` (`src/board.c:154-160`). Two notes posted in the same wall-clock second now get distinct, monotonically increasing timestamps so the `> last_read` unread cursor cannot collide. Test fixtures reset the counter per test (parallel to ROM rebooting `boot_db` globals).
- `BOARD-005` (and `BOARD-006`) — `Board.unread_count_for(char, last_read)` mirrors ROM `unread_notes` (`src/board.c:444-460`) by filtering through `mud.notes.is_note_to(char, note)` (the canonical recipient predicate, factored out of `mud/commands/notes.py`). `do_board` listing now uses the recipient-aware count, so Personal/per-name notes no longer leak into non-recipients' unread totals. `BOARD-006` is subsumed by this fix (ROM's listing filter `unread_notes != BOARD_NOACCESS` is now consistent with what each row displays).
- `BOARD-008` — `load_boards` now sweeps every loaded board for notes whose `expire < now` and appends them to `<board>.old.json` before re-saving the active board, mirroring ROM `load_board`'s archive at `src/board.c:365-383`. Boards no longer grow without bound across reloads.
- `BOARD-012` — `do_note` now mirrors ROM `src/board.c:736-737`: an unknown subcommand (anything other than `read`/`list`/`write`/`remove`/`purge`/`archive`/`catchup` and the Python-only draft verbs) dispatches to `do_help(ch, "note")` instead of returning the generic `"Huh?"`. Test: `tests/integration/test_boards_rom_parity.py::test_note_unknown_subcommand_shows_help`.
- `BOARD-011` — `note write` now mirrors ROM `do_nwrite` at `src/board.c:482-488`: when the player has an in-progress draft whose `text` is empty (e.g. lost link before typing the body), the stale draft is discarded and the actor sees the ROM cancellation notice ("Note in progress cancelled because you did not manage to write any text before losing link.") before a fresh draft is started. Test: `tests/integration/test_boards_rom_parity.py::test_note_write_discards_textless_in_progress_draft`.
- `BOARD-013` — Added `mud.notes.make_note(board_name, sender, to, subject, expire_days, text)` and `mud.notes.personal_message(...)` mirroring ROM `make_note` / `personal_message` at `src/board.c:843-886`. Unknown boards and text exceeding `MAX_NOTE_TEXT` (= `4 * MAX_STRING_LENGTH - 1000` = 17432, per `src/board.h:19`) return `None` (mirroring ROM's silent `bug` + return); on success the note is appended via `Board.post` (so it picks up the unique `last_note_stamp` cursor), persisted with `save_board`, and `expire = current_time + expire_days * 86400`. Unblocks programmatic Personal-board injection for death notifications and system mail.

- `TABLES-001` — `AffectFlag` bit positions (`mud/models/constants.py`) renumbered to match ROM `src/merc.h:953-982` exactly (letters A..dd → bits 0..29). Closes a 20-of-29-bit divergence where `convert_flags_from_letters` was decoding ROM area-file letters with the canonical mapping (e.g. `G` → bit 6) but Python `AffectFlag.SANCTUARY` sat on bit 6, so any letter-form area data was silently mis-aligned with the enum. Pfile schema gains `pfile_version: int` (default `0`); legacy saves are translated on load by `mud/persistence.py:translate_legacy_affect_bits` (covers character `affected_by`, every nested `Affect.bitvector` on persisted items, pet `affected_by`, and pet affect bitvectors), then re-saved at `pfile_version=1`. Reproducer `tests/integration/test_tables_parity.py::test_affect_flag_letters_match_rom_merc_h` flipped from `xfail(strict)` → green; `test_merc_h_letter_macros_match_python_intflag_values` now also covers `AFF_*`. New migration tests in `tests/integration/test_tables_001_affect_migration.py`. Tables.c flips ⚠️ Partial 75% → ✅ AUDITED 100%.
- `TABLES-003` — Programmatic verification of every `src/merc.h` letter-mapped `#define` macro against the matching Python `IntFlag` member's bit value. New test `tests/integration/test_tables_parity.py::test_merc_h_letter_macros_match_python_intflag_values` parses merc.h, resolves A..Z / aa..dd letter tokens, and cross-checks ~210 macros across the `ACT_/PLR_/OFF_/IMM_/RES_/VULN_/FORM_/PART_/COMM_/ROOM_/GATE_/FURN_/WEAPON_` prefixes. Confirms only `AFF_*` (TABLES-001) diverges; all other letter-mapped tables in `src/tables.c` have correct Python bit positions. Acts as a durable regression guard.
- `TABLES-002` — `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py:prefix_lookup_intflag` now consults a ROM `src/tables.c` table-name alias map (`rom_flag_aliases`) before falling back to Python IntFlag member names. ROM-style abbreviations like `+npc`/`+healer`/`+changer`/`+can_loot`/`+dirt_kick`/`+noclangossip` now resolve to the matching Python flag member (`IS_NPC`/`IS_HEALER`/`IS_CHANGER`/`CANLOOT`/`KICK_DIRT`/`NOAUCTION`), restoring ROM `flag_lookup` parity for `do_flag` and OLC.

### Added

- `tables.c` parity audit (`docs/parity/TABLES_C_AUDIT.md`): Phase 1 inventory of all 38 ROM data tables in `src/tables.c` mapped to Python `IntFlag`/`IntEnum` equivalents in `mud/models/constants.py`; Phase 2 spot-checks confirm `ActFlag` / `PlayerFlag` / `OffFlag` / `CommFlag` bit positions match ROM letters A..dd. Three gaps documented: **TABLES-001 (CRITICAL)** — `AffectFlag` bit positions diverge from ROM `merc.h:953-982` (e.g. `AFF_DETECT_GOOD=G=1<<6` in ROM, but `AffectFlag.SANCTUARY=1<<6` in Python); `convert_flags_from_letters` decodes ROM letters with the ROM-correct mapping, so any area-file `AFF G` is silently mis-decoded as `SANCTUARY`. Closure deferred — requires `AffectFlag` renumber + persistence migration plan. TABLES-002 (ROM-name aliases for prefix-match) and TABLES-003 (per-table value verification for the remaining 30+ tables) also open. New `tests/integration/test_tables_parity.py` (4 passing spot-checks + 1 xfail reproducer for TABLES-001).

### Fixed

- `LOOKUP-008` — Added public `liq_lookup(name)` to `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py` mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:138-150` (case-insensitive prefix-match against `LIQUID_TABLE`, returns `-1` on miss). The loader-internal `mud/loaders/obj_loader.py:_liq_lookup` is retained because it intentionally returns `0` (water) on miss for object-load defaults. With this `lookup.c` is ✅ AUDITED at 100% (LOOKUP-001..008 all closed).
- `LOOKUP-007` — Added `item_lookup(name)` to `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py` mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:124-136` (case-insensitive prefix-match against `ItemType` IntEnum, returns the ITEM_X type value, `-1` on miss). Python's `ItemType` IntEnum values match ROM ITEM_X constants 1:1.
- `LOOKUP-006` — Added `size_lookup(name)` to `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py` mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:95-107` (case-insensitive prefix-match against `Size` IntEnum, returns `-1` on miss).
- `LOOKUP-005` — Added `sex_lookup(name)` to `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py` mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:81-93` (case-insensitive prefix-match against `Sex` IntEnum, returns `-1` on miss). ROM `sex_table {none, male, female, either}` maps 1:1 to Python's enum.
- `LOOKUP-004` — Added `position_lookup(name)` to `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py` mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:67-79` (case-insensitive prefix-match against `Position` IntEnum, returns `-1` on miss).
- `LOOKUP-003` — `lookup_clan_id` (`mud/models/clans.py`) now uses ROM-faithful prefix-match instead of exact-match. `lookup_clan_id("lo")` returns clan `loner`, `lookup_clan_id("ro")` returns clan `rom`, mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:53-65` (`clan_lookup` calls `str_prefix`).
- `LOOKUP-002` — `_lookup_flag_bit` (`mud/commands/remaining_rom.py`) now uses ROM-faithful prefix-match instead of exact-match. `flag char Bob plr +holy` matches `HOLYLIGHT` per ROM `src/lookup.c:39-51` (`flag_lookup` calls `str_prefix`). Introduces `mud/utils/prefix_lookup.py` with shared `prefix_lookup_index` and `prefix_lookup_intflag` helpers for the remaining LOOKUP-003..008 closures.
- `LOOKUP-001` — Added `race_lookup(name: str | None) -> int` to `mud/models/races.py` mirroring ROM `src/lookup.c:110-122` (case-insensitive prefix-match against `RACE_TABLE`, fall-through `return 0`). Fixes a latent `ImportError` in `mud/persistence.py:614`'s pet-restore path: every pet load with a non-None race snapshot was crashing with `ImportError: cannot import name 'race_lookup'` because the function had not been ported. Caught during the `lookup.c` parity audit.
- `FLAG-001` — `do_flag` (`mud/commands/remaining_rom.py`) is now a fully-wired immortal command instead of a syntax-validator stub. Mirrors ROM `src/flags.c:44-251`: parses the `=`/`+`/`-`/toggle operator, dispatches `act`/`plr`/`aff`/`immunity`/`resist`/`vuln`/`form`/`parts`/`comm` to the matching Character attribute and IntFlag enum (`ActFlag`, `PlayerFlag`, `AffectFlag`, `ImmFlag`, `FormFlag`, `PartFlag`, `CommFlag`), enforces NPC-only / PC-only field guards (`Use 'plr' for PCs.`, `Use 'act' for NPCs.`, `Form/Parts can't be set on PCs.`, `Comm can't be set on NPCs.`), looks up flag names case-insensitively, rejects unknown flags with `That flag doesn't exist!`, and mutates the matching bit on the victim. Previously the command returned a confirmation string but performed no mutation. New 9-test integration suite in `tests/integration/test_flag_command_parity.py`. FLAG-002 (preserve ROM `flag_type.settable=FALSE` bits across the `=` operator) deferred as MINOR — requires per-bit settable metadata on the IntFlag enums.

### Changed

- `sha256.c` audit completed (`docs/parity/SHA256_C_AUDIT.md`). SHA-256 primitive is delegated to Python's stdlib `hashlib` (byte-for-byte equivalent to ROM `src/sha256.c:131-318`). The `sha256_crypt` password hash (ROM `src/sha256.c:320-336`, plain unsalted single-round SHA-256) is replaced by PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a 16-byte random salt and 100 000 rounds in `mud/security/hash_utils.py` — a deliberate security upgrade with no observable gameplay parity surface (no pfile compatibility goal). Tracker row flipped from ⚠️ Partial → ✅ AUDITED.

### Fixed

- `NANNY-012` — Name validator (`is_valid_account_name` in `mud/account/account_service.py`) now matches ROM `check_parse_name` (`src/comm.c`, called from `nanny.c:188`): minimum length raised from 2 to 3 chars, and `god` / `imp` added to the reserved-name set. Existing reserved tokens (`all auto immortal self someone something the you loner none`) are unchanged.
- `NANNY-013` — Audit correction: ROM `hit=max_hit; mana=max_mana; move=max_move` (src/nanny.c:772-775) is already covered by `from_orm` initialising `max_*` from `perm_*` plus `hit` from saved `hp` (a fresh character is persisted with `hp=perm_hit=100`). NANNY-014 reset_char further guarantees max_* are restored on every login. Added regression test.
- `NANNY-006` — Login fallback room now distinguishes immortals from mortals when no saved room can be loaded. Added `ROOM_VNUM_CHAT = 1200` constant (ROM `src/merc.h:1250`) and `default_login_room_vnum(char)` helper in `mud/net/connection.py`; an `is_admin` character with `char.room is None` lands in ROOM_VNUM_CHAT (the immortal chat room), mortals in ROOM_VNUM_TEMPLE. Mirrors ROM `src/nanny.c:791-802` `IS_IMMORTAL ? ROOM_VNUM_CHAT : ROOM_VNUM_TEMPLE`.
- `NANNY-001` — Account login now disconnects on the first wrong password (returns `None` from `_run_account_login`) instead of looping back to the Account prompt, mirroring ROM `src/nanny.c:269-274` (`close_socket(d)` on bad password). The same path applies to reconnect attempts (matching ROM's "one chance" rule for both fresh logins and CON_BREAK_CONNECT).
- `NANNY-005` — Audit correction: ROM `perm_stat[class.attr_prime] += 3` (src/nanny.c:769) was already implemented in `mud/account/account_service.py:finalize_creation_stats` and locked in by `tests/test_nanny_rom_parity.py::test_prime_attribute_bonus_formula`. ROM applies the bonus during the `level == 0 → 1` promotion inside `CON_READ_MOTD`; Python applies it equivalently during `create_character` since Python characters are persisted at level 1.
- `NANNY-004` — Audit correction: ROM `learned[weapon_gsn] = 40` (src/nanny.c:653) was already implemented in `mud/models/character.py:from_orm` (lines 1047-1051), which uses `_STARTING_WEAPON_SKILL_BY_VNUM` to seed the picked weapon's skill to ≥40 on every load. Audit had cited the prompt-time path. Added regression test.
- `NANNY-003` — Audit correction: ROM `learned[gsn_recall] = 50` (src/nanny.c:581) was already implemented in `mud/models/character.py:from_orm` (lines 1052-1053), which clamps `learned["recall"]` to ≥50 on every character load. Audit had cited the wrong source location. Added regression test to lock in the behavior.
- `NANNY-002` — Login flow now honors the `PlayerFlag.DENY` bit per ROM `src/nanny.c:197-205`: a denied character logs `Denying access to <name>@<host>.`, receives `You are denied access.`, and is rejected before reaching the game loop. New `is_character_denied_access` helper in `mud/net/connection.py`, wired into both load branches of `_select_character`.
- `NANNY-007` — Login flow now broadcasts `<Name> has entered the game.` to other room occupants on every fresh (non-reconnect) login, mirroring ROM `act("$n has entered the game.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM)` at `src/nanny.c:804`. New `broadcast_entry_to_room` helper in `mud/net/connection.py` excludes the actor and uses `act_format` for `$n` substitution.
- `BAN-004` — `BanEntry.matches` (`mud/security/bans.py`) no longer falls through to exact-string match when neither PREFIX nor SUFFIX bit is set; ROM `src/ban.c:104-132` `check_ban` silently skips such entries. Pre-existing tests in `tests/test_bans.py` and `tests/test_account_auth.py` were updated to use `*host*` patterns so a host-specific ban actually matches under ROM semantics.
- `BAN-003` — `_apply_ban` (`mud/commands/admin_commands.py`) now accepts ROM-style prefix abbreviations of the type token (`a`, `n`, `p`, `al`, `ne`, …), matching `src/ban.c:180-191` `!str_prefix(arg2, "all"/"newbies"/"permit")`. Previously required full-prefix `startswith` so single-letter abbreviations were rejected.
- `BAN-002` — `_render_ban_listing` now mirrors ROM's chained ternary at `src/ban.c:166-168`: prints `"newbies"` / `"permit"` / `"all"` based on the corresponding flag bits and falls through to `""` when none is set. Previously defaulted to `"all"` in the no-flag case.
- `BAN-001` — `_render_ban_listing` (`mud/commands/admin_commands.py`) now left-aligns the level column (`:<3d`) to match ROM `src/ban.c:164` `%-3d` instead of right-aligning. Visible in `banlist` / `ban` (no-arg) output.
- `NANNY-011` — `_prompt_new_password` (`mud/net/connection.py`) now rejects passwords containing `~` with ROM message "New password not acceptable, try again." mirroring ROM `src/nanny.c:396-405` file-format poisoner check. Python uses a DB backend so the practical risk is gone, but parity with ROM input validation is preserved.
- `NANNY-014` — Login flow now invokes `reset_char(ch)` on every successful login (ROM `src/nanny.c:760`), restoring `max_hit`/`max_mana`/`max_move` from `pcdata.perm_*`, zeroing transient `mod_stat[]`/`hitroll`/`damroll`/`saving_throw`, and re-applying equipment affects so returning characters land with clean state. Wired into both branches of `mud/net/connection.py:handle_connection` via new `apply_login_state_refresh` helper. Also corrected a latent bug in `mud/handler.py:reset_char` where `range(int(WearLocation.MAX))` raised `AttributeError` (the enum has no `MAX` member); replaced with literal `19` matching ROM `MAX_WEAR` (`src/merc.h:1356`).
- `SPEC-001` — `spec_executioner` yell now broadcasts area-wide (ROM `src/special.c:890-893`) instead of room-only. Added `_yell_area` helper mirroring ROM `do_yell`.
- `SPEC-002` — `spec_guard` now checks ALL room occupants for evil-alignment combatants (ROM `src/special.c:948-972`), not just PCs. The fallback path targeting `alignment < max_evil` fighters now works for NPCs too.
- `SPEC-003` — `spec_mayor` gate open/close now emits proper TO_CHAR (`You open the gate.`) and TO_ROOM (`Mayor opens gate.`) messages, plus reverse-exit toggle. Mirrors ROM `do_function(ch, &do_open, "gate")` / `do_function(ch, &do_close, "gate")`.
- `SPEC-004` — `spec_thief` gold/silver division now uses `c_div` (C integer division) instead of Python `//`, matching ROM `src/special.c:1174-1186`.
- `SPEC-005` — `spec_nasty` ambush now calls `do_murder` (which sets PLR_KILLER flag) instead of `do_kill`, matching ROM `src/special.c:368-371`. Updated `_issue_command` to search multiple command modules.
- `SPEC-006` — `spec_troll_member` and `spec_ogre_member` now check `is_safe()` before attacking, matching ROM `src/special.c:145,213`. Prevents attacks in safe rooms.
- `SPEC-008` — `spec_mayor` movement now uses `move_character()` (with fallback for test SimpleNamespace objects), matching ROM `move_char(ch, dir, FALSE)`.
- `SPEC-012` — `spec_nasty` gold steal now uses `c_div(gold_before, 10)` instead of `gold_before // 10`, matching ROM `src/special.c:394-396`.

- `WIZ-001` — `goto`, `at`, and `transfer` now mirror ROM `src/act_wiz.c:821-839,897-905,957-966` owner/private-room gating by honoring owner-locked rooms, the canonical `ROOM_SOLITARY` flag value, and `is_room_owner()` bypass semantics.
- `WIZ-002` — `violate` now mirrors ROM `src/act_wiz.c:1000-1057`: it targets rooms through `find_location()`, rejects public rooms with the `use goto` hint, and no longer parses directions/exits.
- `WIZ-003` — `protect` now mirrors ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2086-2118` lookup/messages and toggles the real `CommFlag.SNOOP_PROOF` bit instead of the old `COMM_NOTELL` value.
- `WIZ-004` — `snoop` now honors the canonical `CommFlag.SNOOP_PROOF` bit from ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2167-2174`, preventing snooping of correctly protected targets.
- `WIZ-006` — `log` command now mirrors ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2927-2984`: uses `get_char_world()` for lookup, toggles `PlayerFlag.LOG` on `victim.act` instead of a `log_commands` bool, rejects NPCs with ROM message, and uses canonical `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-007` — `force` command now mirrors ROM `src/act_wiz.c:4183-4322`: adds `gods` branch for hero+ players, adds private-room check before forcing individuals, applies trust check to all victims (not just non-NPCs), iterates `descriptor_list` for `force all` and `char_list` for `force players`/`force gods`, and uses canonical `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-005` — `stat` family now mirrors ROM `src/act_wiz.c:1059-1742`: `do_stat` dispatcher uses `get_char_world`/`get_obj_world`/`find_location` per ROM; `do_rstat` outputs Name/Area/Vnum/Sector/Light/Healing/Mana/Room flags/Description/Extra descs/Characters/Objects/Door details; `do_ostat` outputs Name(s)/Vnum/Format/Type/Resets/Short+Long descr/Wear bits/Extra bits/Number+Weight/Level+Cost+Condition+Timer/In room+In obj+Carried by+Wear_loc/Values/Item-type blocks (scroll, potion, pill, wand, staff, drink_con, weapon, armor, container)/Extra descs/Affects; `do_mstat` outputs Name/Vnum/Format/Race/Group/Sex/Room/Count+Killed/Stats/Hp+Mana+Move+Practices/Level+Class+Align+Gold+Silver+Exp/AC per type/Hit+Dam+Saves+Size+Position+Wimpy/Damage+Fighting/Thirst+Hunger+Full+Drunk for PCs/Carry number+Weight/Age+Played/Act/Comm/Offense/Immune/Resist/Vulnerable/Form+Parts/Affected by/Master+Leader+Pet/Security/Short+Long desc/Spec fun/Affected. Added 8 ROM-faithful bit-name helpers (`wear_bit_name`, `extra_bit_name`, `imm_bit_name`, `off_bit_name`, `form_bit_name`, `part_bit_name`, `weapon_bit_name`, `cont_bit_name`) and 5 display helpers (`size_name`, `position_name`, `sex_name`, `class_name`, `race_name`) to `mud/handler.py`.
- `WIZ-008` — Punish commands (`nochannels`, `noemote`, `noshout`, `notell`, `freeze`, `pardon`) now use canonical `CommFlag`/`PlayerFlag` enum values instead of hardcoded wrong bit positions that were corrupting unrelated flags. Added `wiznet()` broadcasts with `WIZ_PENALTIES` + `WIZ_SECURE` flags. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-009` — `peace` now calls `stop_fighting(person, True)` instead of setting `fighting = None` (properly clearing all combat references). Uses `ActFlag.AGGRESSIVE` enum instead of hardcoded `0x20`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-010` — `invis` and `incognito` now broadcast room-wide `act()` messages per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:4329-4420`. `incognito` clears `reply` when setting a specific level. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-011` — Echo family (`echo`, `recho`, `zecho`, `pecho`) now iterates `descriptor_list` with `CON_PLAYING` filter per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:674-777` instead of `registry.players` dict. `pecho` uses ROM trust check and exact messages. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-012` — `bamfin`/`bamfout` now use `smash_tilde()` and ROM `strstr` case-sensitive name check per `src/act_wiz.c:455-512`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-013` — `wizlock`/`newlock` now use `\n\r` line endings per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:3150-3188`.
- `WIZ-014` — `holylight` now returns empty string for NPCs (ROM parity) and uses `\n\r` line endings per `src/act_wiz.c:4422-4439`.
- `WIZ-015` — `slookup` now supports `all` arg, shows `Slot` column, uses prefix-match lookup per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:3191-3229`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-016` — `sockets` now uses `\n\r` line endings per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:4140-4176`.
- `WIZ-017` — `deny` rewritten to ROM parity per `src/act_wiz.c:517-557`: SET-only (not toggle), uses `get_char_world()` not `character_registry`, adds `PlayerFlag.DENY` flag, wiznet broadcast, `stop_fighting(victim, True)`, forced quit, `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-018` — `switch` now has private-room check (`is_room_owner`/`room_is_private`) and wiznet broadcast per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2202-2269`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-019` — `return` now has full ROM message, prompt cleanup, and wiznet broadcast per `src/act_wiz.c:2273-2303`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-020` — `smote` now uses ROM `_smote_substitute` letter-by-letter algorithm, case-sensitive `strstr` name check, skips no-descriptor viewers per `src/act_wiz.c:362-453`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-021` — `pecho` now uses ROM trust check (`get_trust(char) != MAX_LEVEL`) and exact messages per `src/act_wiz.c:750-777`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-022` — `disconnect` now follows ROM descriptor-list victim lookup per `src/act_wiz.c:561-614`. Added `\n\r` line endings.
- `WIZ-023` — `guild` now uses `lookup_clan_id`/`CLAN_TABLE` per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:196-249`; distinguishes independent-clan (`"a <name>"`) vs member-clan (`"member of clan <Name>"`) messaging; uses `str_prefix`-style match for "none"; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-024` — `outfit` now always returns `"You have been equipped by Mota.\n\r"` per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:251-310` (removed "You already have your equipment" branch).
- `WIZ-025` — `copyover` now iterates `descriptor_list` with `CON_PLAYING` filter per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:4498-4588`; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-026` — `qmconfig` verified as already ROM-faithful per `src/act_wiz.c:4685-4787`; added test coverage for `"I have no clue..."` fallback.
- `wiznet()` broadcast now iterates `descriptor_list` with `CON_PLAYING` filter per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:171-194`; falls back to `character_registry` in test environments without descriptor setup.
- `WIZ-027` — `load` syntax messages now have `\n\r` line endings per ROM; re-invokes `do_load("")` on invalid type.
- `WIZ-028` — `mload` now returns `"Ok.\n\r"` instead of `"You have created {name}!"` per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2489-2517`; added `wiznet()` broadcast; safe `getattr` for registry.
- `WIZ-029` — `oload` now returns `"Ok.\n\r"` instead of `"You have created {name}!"` per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2521-2570`; added `wiznet()` broadcast; ROM typo preserved in level message; fixed `char.inventory` slot name.
- `WIZ-030` — `purge` trust check now uses ROM `<=` comparison per `src/act_wiz.c:2625`; added `"X tried to purge you!\n\r"` notification to victim; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-031` — `restore` iterates `descriptor_list` for `restore all` per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2820-2845`; added wiznet broadcasts; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-032` — `clone` now has wiznet broadcasts per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:2338-2455`; added trust check for mob cloning; uses `obj.carried_by` to determine placement; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-033` — `set` command now uses `\n\r` line endings and re-invokes `do_set("")` on invalid type per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:3233-3275`.
- `WIZ-034` — `sset` now uses `getattr(registry, "skill_table", [])` iteration; added `(use the name of the skill, not the number)` hint; all messages have `\n\r` per ROM `src/act_wiz.c:3278-3352`.
- `WIZ-035` — `mset` now fully ROM-parity per `src/act_wiz.c:3355-3790`: uses `smash_tilde()`; uses `get_max_train()` for stat ranges; `level` rejects PCs; `sex` sets `pcdata.true_sex`; `hp`/`mana`/`move` set PC `perm_*` values; uses ROM field name prefixes (`startswith()`); adds fields: `class`, `race`, `group`, `hours`, `thirst`, `drunk`, `full`, `hunger`; `security` uses `ch->pcdata->security` range; clears `victim.zone`; re-invokes `do_mset("")` on unknown field; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-036` — `oset` now fully ROM-parity per `src/act_wiz.c:3958-4067`: uses `smash_tilde()`; adds `v0`-`v4` aliases; caps `value0` at `min(50, value)` per ROM:3998; adds `timer` field; uses ROM field prefixes; re-invokes `do_oset("")` on unknown field; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-037` — `rset` now fully ROM-parity per `src/act_wiz.c:4071-4136`: uses `smash_tilde()`; uses `find_location()` for room lookup; adds private-room check (`is_room_owner`/`room_is_private`); adds "Value must be numeric.\n\r" check; uses ROM field prefixes; re-invokes `do_rset("")` on unknown field; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `WIZ-038` — `string` now fully ROM-parity per `src/act_wiz.c:3793-3954`: uses `smash_tilde()`; adds `spec` field via `get_spec_fun()`; `long` appends `\n\r`; uses `set_title()` for title; uses ROM field prefixes; adds ROM `extra_descr` insertion; re-invokes `do_string("")` on bad type; all messages have `\n\r`.
- `ALIAS-001` — `alia` now returns the ROM `src/alias.c:97-100` typo-guard text instead of a generic helper string.
- `ALIAS-002` — `alias` now mirrors ROM `src/alias.c:112-220`: exact list/query/set/realias messages, reserved-word checks, quote/name validation, `delete`/`prefix` expansion guards, and the five-alias limit.
- `ALIAS-003` — alias substitution now mirrors ROM `src/alias.c:69-99`: one expansion pass only, truncation warning handling, and `mud.rom_api.substitute_alias()` now returns the expanded string instead of an internal tuple.
- `ALIAS-004` — `unalias` now mirrors ROM `src/alias.c:236-274` prompt/removal/failure messages.
- `ALIAS-005` — prefix preprocessing before alias expansion now mirrors ROM `src/alias.c:49-61,88-95`, including the overlong-line warning and full-`prefix` bypass semantics.
- `HEALER-001` — `heal` now finds NPC healers via `ACT_IS_HEALER` and shows the ROM `src/healer.c:49-79` service table instead of a compressed summary string.
- `HEALER-002` — `heal mana` now mirrors ROM `src/healer.c:147-190`: silver-aware affordability, `deduct_cost`, healer payout, TO_ROOM utterance, and `dice(2, 8) + level/3` mana restoration.
- `HEALER-003` — `heal refresh` now dispatches to the underlying ROM spell path from `src/healer.c:156-160,196` instead of a placeholder full-restore shortcut.
- `HEALER-004` — `heal heal` now dispatches to the underlying ROM `spell_heal` path from `src/healer.c:107-112,196` instead of always filling hit points to max.

## [2.6.15] - 2026-04-28

Closes the `scan.c` audit (P2): all 3 gaps fixed, ROM-faithful TO_ROOM/TO_CHAR
broadcasts on the `scan` command, divergent header and fallback lines removed.

### Added

- `SCAN-001` — `do_scan` with no argument now emits the TO_ROOM broadcast
  `"$n looks all around."` so onlookers see the scan, mirroring ROM
  `src/scan.c:60` (`act("$n looks all around.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM);`).
- `SCAN-002` — directional `do_scan` now emits the TO_CHAR/TO_ROOM act() pair
  `"You peer intently <dir>."` / `"$n peers intently <dir>."`, mirroring ROM
  `src/scan.c:89-90`.

### Fixed

- `SCAN-002` — directional `do_scan` no longer prints a spurious
  `"Looking <dir> you see:"` header. ROM builds that string into `buf` at
  `src/scan.c:91` but never calls `send_to_char(buf, ch)`; the only visible
  scanner-facing message is the `"You peer intently <dir>."` act().
- `SCAN-003` — `do_scan` no longer emits non-ROM fallback lines
  (`"No one is nearby."`, `"Nothing of note."`) when no visible characters
  are found. ROM emits only the act() messages and header in that case
  (`src/scan.c:48-104`).

## [2.6.14] - 2026-04-28

Closes the `db2.c` audit (P1): all CRITICAL/IMPORTANT mob-loader gaps fixed.
Both `.are` and JSON loaders now match ROM `src/db2.c:load_mobiles` for AC
scaling, `ACT_IS_NPC` enforcement, race-table flag merge, and first-char
uppercase of long_descr/description. Two MINOR gaps (`DB2-004` kill_table,
`DB2-005` single-line fread_string) remain deferred — both documented as
not user-reachable in the current port.

### Fixed

- `DB2-003` — both mob loaders now uppercase the first character of
  `long_descr` and `description` at load time, mirroring ROM
  `src/db2.c:236-237` (`pMobIndex->long_descr[0] = UPPER(...)`).
  Previously mob protos with a lowercase first letter rendered that way in
  room/look output. `.are` loader normalizes after `read_string_tilde`;
  JSON loader normalizes inline at MobIndex construction.
- `DB2-006` — mob armor-class fields (`ac_pierce`/`ac_bash`/`ac_slash`/`ac_exotic`)
  are now multiplied by 10 at load time in both the `.are` loader
  (`mud/loaders/mob_loader.py`) and the JSON loader (`mud/loaders/json_loader.py`),
  mirroring ROM `src/db2.c:273-276`. Previously every loaded NPC had an AC value
  10× off in ROM's negative-AC convention, making them noticeably easier to hit.
  `mud/scripts/convert_are_to_json.py` now divides back when re-emitting JSON so
  the JSON files stay a faithful mirror of the raw `.are` upstream.
- `DB2-002` — both mob loaders now merge ROM `race_table[race].{act, aff,
  off, imm, res, vuln, form, parts}` flag bits into each loaded mob's
  letter-based flag fields, mirroring ROM `src/db2.c:239-242,279-286,295-297`.
  Previously race-derived intrinsics (dragon flying, troll regeneration,
  modron immunities, undead form/parts) were silently dropped at load time.
  Implemented in `mud/loaders/mob_loader.py:merge_race_flags`; the JSON
  loader (`mud/loaders/json_loader.py`) invokes it after MobIndex construction.
- `DB2-001` — both mob loaders now unconditionally OR `ACT_IS_NPC` (letter `A`)
  into every prototype's `act_flags` letter string, mirroring ROM
  `src/db2.c:239`. Previously a mob whose area-file flags omitted the `A`
  letter would spawn with `IS_NPC()` returning false, breaking every
  downstream `is_npc` check (combat, save, look, mobprog dispatch).

## [2.6.13] - 2026-04-28

Closes the cross-file dependency that blocked `interp.c` completion:
`WEAR-010` (do_wear dispatches weapons to wield) and `WEAR-011`
(do_hold auto-replaces) cleared the way for `INTERP-013` to collapse
`do_wield`/`do_hold` into aliases on `do_wear`, mirroring ROM
`cmd_table[]`. `interp.c` now closes at **24/24 fixed + 1
closed-deferred**.

### Fixed

- `act_obj.c:WEAR-010` — `do_wear` now dispatches `ITEM_WEAPON` items
  to the WIELD branch (`_dispatch_wield`) instead of rejecting with
  "You need to wield weapons, not wear them." Mirrors ROM
  `src/act_obj.c:1401-1697` `wear_obj` single-dispatcher design where
  `do_wear`/`do_wield`/`do_hold` are all the same function. Tests:
  `tests/integration/test_equipment_system.py::test_wear_010_do_wear_dispatches_weapon_to_wield`.
- `act_obj.c:WEAR-011` — `do_hold` now auto-unequips an existing held
  item via `_unequip_to_inventory()` instead of rejecting with
  "You're already holding {name}." Mirrors ROM
  `src/act_obj.c:1670-1677` `remove_obj(WEAR_HOLD, fReplace=TRUE)`
  semantics. Tests:
  `tests/integration/test_equipment_system.py::test_wear_011_do_hold_auto_replaces_existing_held`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-013` — `wield` and `hold` now dispatch to `do_wear`
  via the dispatcher's `aliases=("wield", "hold")` on the `wear`
  Command, mirroring ROM `cmd_table[]` (src/interp.c:103, 215, 232).
  `do_wield`/`do_hold` collapsed to thin wrappers around `do_wear`
  for direct-import callers. Closes `interp.c` to **24/24 fixed +
  1 closed-deferred** (100% of closeable gaps). Tests:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_013_wear_wield_hold_share_do_wear`.

### Changed

- `wield <non-weapon>` and `hold <non-holdable>` no longer reject with
  command-specific errors ("You can't wield that." / "You can't hold
  that."). They now run the full `do_wear` dispatcher, so
  e.g. `wield ring` wears the ring on a finger — ROM-faithful since
  ROM has no separate `do_wield`/`do_hold` functions.
- `wield` and `hold` with no argument now emit
  `"Wear, wield, or hold what?"` instead of `"Wield what?"` /
  `"Hold what?"`, mirroring ROM's single-prompt design.

## [2.6.12] - 2026-04-28

Closes the remaining `interp.c` parser/extension gaps:
`INTERP-015` (port ROM `one_argument` to replace `shlex.split`) and
`INTERP-016` (verify `tail_chain` is a no-op in stock ROM and close-defer).
`interp.c` is now 22/24 gaps fixed + 1 closed-deferred + 1 deferred-pending
(`INTERP-013`, blocked on `ACT_OBJ_C` `do_wear` port).

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-015` — `_split_command_and_args` no longer routes
  through `shlex.split`; the new `_one_argument()` mirrors ROM
  `src/interp.c:766-798` byte-for-byte (lowercases head, single-char
  `'` and `"` quote sentinels with no nesting, backslash treated
  literally, surrounding whitespace stripped). `shlex` import dropped.
  Tests:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_015_one_argument_matches_rom`
  (8 cases).

### Changed

- `interp.c:INTERP-016` — closed-deferred. Confirmed `tail_chain()`
  is `return;` only in stock ROM 2.4b6 (`src/db.c:3929`); empty
  hook used by some ROM derivatives for stack-tail-call extension.
  Stock-ROM behavior is "do nothing", which Python already matches
  by omission.
- `tests/test_alias_parity.py::test_alias_case_sensitivity` renamed
  to `test_alias_case_insensitive_lookup_matches_rom` and flipped to
  assert ROM-correct behavior — ROM `do_alias` stores keys via
  `one_argument` which lowercases (`src/alias.c:127, 217`), so an
  uppercase input head expands a lowercased alias key. The previous
  Python assertion mirrored pre-port `shlex` behavior, not ROM.

## [2.6.11] - 2026-04-28

Closes the three small position/trust gates left in `interp.c`
(`INTERP-004`/`-005`/`-006`). `interp.c` is now 20/24 gaps closed
(83%); only `INTERP-013` (deferred until `do_wear` ports the missing
wield/hold logic), `INTERP-015` (shlex/one_argument port), and
`INTERP-016` (`tail_chain` documentation, no-op) remain.

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-004` — `shout` now requires trust 3 to match ROM
  (`src/interp.c:200`). Previously had no `min_trust` (defaulted to 0).
  Test: `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_004_shout_requires_trust_3`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-005` — `murder` now requires trust 5 to match ROM
  (`src/interp.c:247`). Test:
  `test_interp_005_murder_requires_trust_5`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-006` — `music` `min_position` lowered from
  `RESTING` to `SLEEPING` to match ROM (`src/interp.c:93`). Test:
  `test_interp_006_music_min_position_sleeping`.

## [2.6.10] - 2026-04-27

Closes five more `interp.c` gaps: command-mapping cleanup
(`INTERP-009/010/011/012/014` — `hit`/`take`/`junk`/`tap`/`go`/`:`
now route to canonical handlers), `do_commands` column-padding fix
(`INTERP-024`), and the prefix-order sweep (`INTERP-017`) — Python's
prefix scan now mirrors ROM `cmd_table[]` declaration order via a
250-entry table, so 1- and 2-letter abbreviations resolve identically
to ROM. `INTERP-013` (collapse `do_wield`/`do_hold` into `do_wear`)
deferred — Python `do_wear` is missing strength/skill/two-hand checks
and HOLD auto-unequip that the separate functions currently provide;
collapsing now would regress behavior. `interp.c` is now 17/24 gaps
closed (71%).

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-009` — `"hit"` now dispatches to `do_kill` as a
  ROM-style alias on the kill `Command`; deleted redundant `do_hit`
  stub from `player_info.py` (`src/interp.c:88`). Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_009_hit_routes_to_do_kill`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-010` — `"take"` now dispatches to `do_get` as an
  alias on the get `Command`; deleted `do_take` stub
  (`src/interp.c:226`). Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_010_take_routes_to_do_get`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-011` — `"junk"` and `"tap"` now dispatch to
  `do_sacrifice` as aliases; deleted both stubs from `remaining_rom.py`
  (`src/interp.c:228-229`). Test:
  `test_interp_011_junk_tap_route_to_do_sacrifice`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-012` — `"go"` now dispatches to `do_enter` as an
  alias; deleted `do_go` stub (`src/interp.c:263`). Test:
  `test_interp_012_go_routes_to_do_enter`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-014` — `":"` now dispatches to `do_immtalk` as an
  alias; deleted `do_colon` stub from `typo_guards.py` whose
  `"Say what on the immortal channel?"` placeholder was masking ROM's
  NOWIZ toggle behavior (`src/interp.c:356`). Test:
  `test_interp_014_colon_routes_to_do_immtalk`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-024` — `do_commands`/`do_wizhelp` no longer strip
  trailing whitespace from rows; ROM emits each name as `%-12s` with
  full column padding preserved (`src/interp.c:815-823`). Test:
  `test_interp_024_do_commands_preserves_12char_column_padding`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-017` — `resolve_command` now walks a 250-entry
  ROM-faithful `_PREFIX_TABLE` in `src/interp.c` declaration order
  instead of Python's feature-grouped `COMMANDS` list; removed the
  exact-match shortcut so prefix resolution mirrors ROM
  `interpret()` exactly (e.g. `"go"` now resolves to `goto` not
  `enter`, matching ROM's hand-ordered prefix block). Sweep test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_prefix_order.py::test_interp_017_prefix_winner_matches_rom`
  parses `src/interp.c` at collection time and asserts every
  single-letter prefix plus 20 curated 2-letter prefixes resolve
  identically to ROM (45 cases).

## [2.6.9] - 2026-04-27

Closes four `interp.c` dispatcher-level gaps in one session: empty-input
behavior (`INTERP-007`), ROM punctuation aliases (`INTERP-008`), snoop
forwarding (`INTERP-002`), and verified the wiznet `WIZ_SECURE` mirror
that was already in place (`INTERP-003`). `interp.c` is now 11/24 gaps
closed (46%).

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-007` — empty input now returns silently to match
  ROM `interpret()` (`src/interp.c:401-404`). Previously emitted the
  literal `"What?"`. Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_007_empty_input_returns_silently`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-008` — added ROM punctuation aliases `.` → `gossip`,
  `,` → `emote`, `/` → `recall` to `COMMAND_INDEX`
  (`src/interp.c:184,186,272`). Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_008_punctuation_aliases_route_to_rom_handlers`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-002` — `process_command` now forwards the input
  logline to `desc.snoop_by.character.messages` prefixed with `"% "`
  (`src/interp.c:491-496`). Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_002_snoop_forwards_logline_to_snooper`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-003` — verified `log_admin_command` already mirrors
  logged commands to wiznet `WIZ_SECURE` with ROM-style `$`/`{`
  doubling (`mud/admin_logging/admin.py:107-114`,
  `src/interp.c:468-489`). Audit row description was stale. Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_dispatcher.py::test_interp_003_logged_command_mirrors_to_wiznet_secure`.

## [2.6.8] - 2026-04-27

Closes the immortal command trust drift (`INTERP-001`). All 43 commands
that were gated too low now match ROM `cmd_table[]` tier-for-tier. This
is a security-relevant fix — previously a `LEVEL_IMMORTAL` (52) character
could invoke commands ROM gates at L1..ML (53..60).

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-001` — raised `min_trust` on 43 immortal commands
  in `mud/commands/dispatcher.py` to match ROM `cmd_table[]` trust
  tiers (`src/interp.c:63-381`, `src/interp.h:34-44`). Affected
  tiers: ML, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7. Security-relevant — closes
  privilege drift where `LEVEL_IMMORTAL` (52) characters could
  invoke commands ROM gates at L1..ML (53..60). Test:
  `tests/integration/test_interp_trust.py::test_interp_001_command_trust_matches_rom` (50 parameters).

## [2.6.7] - 2026-04-27

`interp.c` social-cluster audit complete (6/6 social gaps closed). Both
remaining gaps (prefix lookup + literal "not found" message) shipped
with integration coverage; socials suite now 31/31. `interp.c` overall
audit progress: 6/24 gaps closed (25%) — non-social gaps (trust drift,
dispatcher hooks, command-mapping cleanup) remain open.

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-021` — social command lookup now mirrors ROM
  `str_prefix` semantics so partial names (e.g. `gigg` → `giggle`)
  resolve in load order. Added `mud.models.social.find_social()` and
  routed both the dispatcher fallback (`mud/commands/dispatcher.py`)
  and `perform_social` (`mud/commands/socials.py`) through it. Mirrors
  ROM `src/interp.c:584-592`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-022` — `perform_social` now emits the literal
  `"They aren't here."` when the targeted victim is absent, matching
  ROM `src/interp.c:637-640`. The fabricated `social.not_found` field
  (which has no counterpart in ROM's social table) is no longer used.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-04-27

`interp.c` ROM parity audit started — full audit doc with 24 stable gap
IDs (`INTERP-001`..`INTERP-024`) created. Closed the entire CRITICAL+
IMPORTANT social-cluster subset of `check_social` (`src/interp.c:597-685`):
position gates, NOEMOTE, sleeping snore exception, and the NPC slap/echo
auto-react via `mud.utils.rng_mm.number_bits(4)`. Socials integration
suite grew from 13 to 27 tests, all green.

### Fixed

- `interp.c:INTERP-018` — `perform_social` now refuses socials from
  characters in `Position.DEAD`, `MORTAL`, `INCAP`, or `STUNNED` and
  emits ROM's exact response messages
  (`"Lie still; you are DEAD."`, `"You are hurt far too bad for that."`,
  `"You are too stunned to do that."`). Mirrors
  `src/interp.c:603-616` (`check_social` position gate).
- `interp.c:INTERP-019` — sleeping characters now receive
  `"In your dreams, or what?"` for every social except `snore`
  (the canonical Furey exception). Mirrors `src/interp.c:618-626`.
- `interp.c:INTERP-020` — players punished with the `COMM_NOEMOTE`
  flag now receive `"You are anti-social!"` when attempting any
  social. NPCs are unaffected per ROM's `IS_NPC` short-circuit.
  Mirrors `src/interp.c:597-601`.

### Added

- `interp.c:INTERP-023` — NPC auto-reaction to player socials. When
  a non-NPC socials at an awake, non-charmed, non-switched NPC,
  `mud.utils.rng_mm.number_bits(4)` (0..15) decides the response:
  values 0..8 echo the social back at the player with the actor and
  victim swapped; values 9..12 produce a slap
  (`"$n slaps $N." / "You slap $N." / "$n slaps you."`); values 13..15
  fall through silently. Mirrors `src/interp.c:652-685`.

## [2.6.5] - 2026-04-27

`mob_prog.c` ROM parity audit complete — all 7 gaps closed (2 CRITICAL,
4 IMPORTANT, 1 MINOR). MOBprog predicate evaluation, greet/grall trigger
exclusivity, $-code expansion, and program-flow state-machine now match
ROM 2.4b6 behaviour.

### Fixed

- MOBPROG-007: `_program_flow` now logs a warning and aborts the program when
  an `if`/`or`/`and` keyword is not in ROM's `fn_keyword[]` table, mirroring
  the `bug()` + `return` paths at `src/mob_prog.c:1049-1056`, `1076-1083`,
  `1103-1109`. Typo'd predicates fail loudly instead of silently evaluating
  to False. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mobprog_program_flow.py`. Also corrected the
  `test_simple_quest_accept_workflow` fixture program to use the real ROM
  keyword `carries` (not the previously-silent invalid `has_item`).
- MOBPROG-006: `_expand_arg` `$R` substitution now replicates the ROM
  long-standing bug at `src/mob_prog.c:798-799` — the visibility gate uses
  `rch` (random victim) but the substituted string is `ch->short_descr`
  (NPC actor) or `ch->name` (PC actor). Per AGENTS.md ROM Parity Rules,
  QuickMUD reproduces the bug. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mobprog_predicates.py`.
- MOBPROG-005: `_program_flow` `else` branch now resets
  `state[level] = IN_BLOCK` mirroring ROM `src/mob_prog.c:1138`. Structural
  state-machine parity only — no observable divergence on valid programs;
  regression coverage added at
  `tests/integration/test_mobprog_program_flow.py`.
- MOBPROG-004: `_cmd_eval` `clan` / `race` / `class` checks now resolve their
  name keyword via a ROM-style prefix lookup over `CLAN_TABLE`, `RACE_TABLE`,
  and `CLASS_TABLE` (mirroring ROM `clan_lookup` / `race_lookup` /
  `class_lookup`, `src/mob_prog.c:601-609`) instead of comparing the int
  attribute to the literal name string. `if class $n mage`,
  `if race $n dragon`, `if clan $n thieves` now match ROM. Integration
  coverage at `tests/integration/test_mobprog_predicates.py`.
- MOBPROG-003: `_cmd_eval` `vnum` check now compares against `lval=0` when the
  target is a PC instead of returning False. Mirrors ROM `src/mob_prog.c:631-642`
  — `lval` initialises to 0 and is only overwritten for NPCs, so
  `if vnum $n == 0` is True against PCs and `if vnum $n != 0` is False.
  Integration coverage at `tests/integration/test_mobprog_predicates.py`.
- MOBPROG-002: `mp_greet_trigger` no longer falls through to GRALL after a
  failed GREET percent roll. Mirrors ROM `src/mob_prog.c:1340-1345` where the
  GREET / GRALL branches are exclusive — a mob that is awake, can see the
  entrant, and has a GREET trigger only attempts GREET; GRALL is reserved for
  the busy/blind path. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mobprog_greet_trigger.py`.
- MOBPROG-001: `_cmd_eval` `objexists` now walks `mud.models.obj.object_registry`
  (mirroring ROM `get_obj_world`, `src/mob_prog.c:399`) instead of only the
  current room and same-room carriers. Mob programs that gate on
  `if objexists <vnum|name>` against globally-placed items now match ROM
  semantics. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mobprog_predicates.py`.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-04-27

`mob_cmds.c` ROM parity audit complete — all 18 gaps closed (6 CRITICAL,
9 IMPORTANT, 3 MINOR). MOBprog script commands (`mob kill`, `assist`,
`oload`, `flee`, `cast`, `call`, `damage`, `junk`, `purge`, `transfer`)
now match ROM 2.4b6 behaviour for charm/master defence, position gates,
target-type dispatch, level bounds, NO_MOB respect, recursion, and
bug-log emission on script authoring errors.

### Fixed

- MOBCMD-017: `do_mptransfer` now mirrors ROM's recursive structure — a
  literal `mob transfer all <loc>` recursively dispatches
  `do_mptransfer(ch, "<pcname> <loc>")` once per PC in the room
  (`src/mob_cmds.c:791-806`) so each victim re-runs the full validation
  pipeline (private-room check, location resolution). Previously the
  Python implementation inlined the iteration with a direct
  `_transfer_character` call. NPCs are skipped exactly as in ROM line
  799. Integration coverage at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_transfer.py`.
- MOBCMD-018: verified `do_mpflee` already checks `ch.fighting` as the
  first guard, mirroring ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:1266-1267`. The audit row
  was stale and is now closed without a code change.
- MOBCMD-007: `do_mppurge` no longer accepts the literal `"all"` token
  as a synonym for the no-arg purge-everything form. ROM
  `src/mob_cmds.c:631-665` treats an empty argument as purge-all and has
  no `"all"` keyword — the token falls through to the name-resolution
  branch like any other word. Also added the missing
  `Mppurge - Bad argument` (ROM line 663) and `Mppurge - Purging a PC`
  (ROM line 671) bug logs via the new `_bug()` helper. The previously
  divergent unit test (`test_mppurge_all_cleans_room`) now uses the
  no-arg form. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_purge.py`.
- MOBCMD-013: `do_mpdamage` now emits a ROM-style `bug()` warning via
  Python's `logging` module when the min or max argument is non-numeric,
  mirroring ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:1105-1107` + `1113-1115`. Previously the
  function silently returned, swallowing what is a script-authoring
  error. A new module-local `_bug()` helper in `mud/mob_cmds.py` mirrors
  ROM's `bug("Mp... - <reason> from vnum %d.", vnum)` pattern; expect
  this helper to be reused as further `mob_cmds` gaps are closed.
  Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_damage.py::TestMpDamageNonNumericArgsBugLog`.
- MOBCMD-009: `do_mpflee` now respects `ROOM_NO_MOB` on a candidate
  destination when the fleeing character is an NPC, mirroring ROM
  `src/mob_cmds.c:1277-1280`. Previously script-driven NPC flees would
  pour mobs into rooms flagged NO_MOB. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_flee.py::TestMpFleeNoMobRoomFlag`.
- MOBCMD-006: `do_mpoload` now validates the optional level argument
  against ROM's `level < 0 || level > get_trust(ch)` check
  (`src/mob_cmds.c:575-580`) and refuses to spawn the object when out of
  range. Previously the level was accepted unconditionally so a script
  could load objects above the mob's trust ceiling. Integration coverage
  at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_oload.py`.
- MOBCMD-004: `do_mpjunk` (MOBprog `junk` script command) now matches
  ROM's empty-needle behaviour: `mob junk all.` (trailing dot, no
  suffix) discards nothing because ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:436` defers to
  `is_name(&arg[4], ...)` which returns FALSE for an empty string.
  Python had been short-circuiting on `not suffix` and discarding every
  carried object. Bare `mob junk all` still clears inventory as before.
  Integration coverage at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_junk.py`.
- MOBCMD-002: `do_mpassist` now enforces ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:393`'s full
  guard set — `victim == ch`, `ch->fighting != NULL`, and
  `victim->fighting == NULL`. Previously only the third clause was
  checked, so a script mob already in a fight could be redirected onto a
  new target via `mob assist`, and a script mob could nonsensically
  assist itself. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_assist.py`.
- MOBCMD-001: `do_mpkill` now refuses when the script mob is charmed
  (`AffectFlag.CHARM`) and the chosen victim is its master, mirroring ROM
  `src/mob_cmds.c:364-369`. Previously a charmed mob scripted to
  `mob kill <master>` would attack its own charmer. Integration coverage
  at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_kill.py::TestMpKillCharmedMasterGuard`.
- MOBCMD-015 + MOBCMD-016: `do_mpcall` (MOBprog `call` script command) now
  parses the optional obj1/obj2 tokens from `mob call <vnum> <victim>
  <obj1> <obj2>` and resolves them via `_find_obj_here` (the `get_obj_here`
  analog), forwarding both to `mobprog.call_prog`. ROM
  `src/mob_cmds.c:1217-1252` initialises obj1/obj2 to NULL and only sets
  them when the corresponding token resolves through `get_obj_here`; the
  Python implementation had been dropping both args entirely so called
  sub-programs could never receive object context. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_call.py`.
- MOBCMD-011 + MOBCMD-012: `do_mpcast` (MOBprog `cast` script command) now
  resolves the JSON `target` string into a canonical `_TargetType` IntEnum
  mirroring ROM `TAR_*` (`src/magic.h`) and dispatches on the enum, matching
  ROM's switch in `src/mob_cmds.c:1043-1066`. The previously string-keyed
  branches were drift-prone; in particular the `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_DEF/OFF/INV`
  cases now require an object (no character fallback) and `TAR_CHAR_DEFENSIVE`
  defaults to `ch` when the lookup fails, matching ROM lines 1055 + 1060-1065.
  Integration coverage at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_cast.py`.
- MOBCMD-003: `do_mpkill` now gates on `ch.position == Position.FIGHTING`
  (matching ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:361`) instead of the looser
  `ch.fighting is not None` check, and short-circuits self-attacks via the
  missing `victim is ch` guard from the same ROM line. Integration coverage
  at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_kill.py`.
- MOBCMD-008: `do_mpflee` now performs 6 `rng_mm.number_door()` random-door
  attempts before giving up, mirroring ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:1272-1286`.
  Previously the function iterated the exits list in order, so the first
  valid exit always won — wrong distribution for ROM-faithful flee
  behavior. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_flee.py::TestMpFleeRandomDoor`.
- MOBCMD-010: `do_mpflee` (MOBprog `flee` script command) now routes through
  `mud.world.movement.move_character` instead of the silent `_move_to_room`
  helper, mirroring ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:1283`
  (`move_char(ch, door, FALSE)`). Leave/arrive broadcasts, mp_exit/entry
  triggers, and the rest of the canonical movement pipeline now fire on
  script-driven flees. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_flee.py`.
- MOBCMD-005: `do_mpoload` (MOBprog `oload` script command) now accepts the
  optional `level` argument from `mob oload <vnum> [level] [R|W]`, mirroring
  ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:538-614`. When omitted, level defaults to
  `get_trust(ch)`; the spawned object's `level` is set post-spawn to mirror
  ROM `create_object(pObjIndex, level)`. Previously the level token was parsed
  but discarded, so script-loaded objects always took the prototype's raw
  level. Integration coverage at `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_oload.py`.
- MOBCMD-014: `do_mpdamage` (MOBprog `damage` script command) now routes
  through `mud.combat.engine.apply_damage` instead of raw-decrementing
  `victim.hit`. Mirrors ROM `src/mob_cmds.c:1132-1145`
  (`damage(victim, victim, amount, TYPE_UNDEFINED, DAM_NONE, FALSE)`) so
  the death pipeline, position updates, fight triggers, and corpse
  handling fire on script-driven damage. Integration coverage at
  `tests/integration/test_mob_cmds_damage.py`.

### Changed

- `docs/parity/ACT_OBJ_C_AUDIT.md` and `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md`
  refreshed to reflect that ROM `src/act_obj.c` is at 100% parity. Apr 27, 2026
  formal sweep verified all 12 audited functions
  (`do_get`/`do_put`/`do_drop`/`do_give`/`do_remove`/`do_sacrifice`/`do_quaff`/
  `do_drink`/`do_eat`/`do_fill`/`do_pour`/`do_recite`/`do_brandish`/`do_zap`
  plus `do_wear`/`do_wield`/`do_hold` and `do_steal`) against current Python;
  the recent batch commits (`97c901e` do_drop parity batch, `517542b` close
  get/put/drop/give/wear/sacrifice/recite/brandish/zap/steal gaps) closed all
  outstanding gaps. 193 act_obj-area integration tests green. P1 audited count
  rises from 5/11 (81%) to 6/11 (86%). No code changes — documentation
  reconciliation only.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Three project-local skills under `.claude/skills/` encoding the ROM 2.4b6 →
  Python parity loop: `rom-parity-audit` (file-level 5-phase audit),
  `rom-gap-closer` (single-gap TDD close flow), `rom-session-handoff`
  (end-of-session SESSION_SUMMARY + SESSION_STATUS + CHANGELOG generation).
- `CLAUDE.md` "Porting workflow" section: decision-tree mapping of when to
  invoke each skill plus dependencies between them.

### Changed

- `README.md` Project Status / badges refreshed to current state: version
  `2.6.2`, tests `3508/3521 passing` (99.6%) with 11 skipped and 2 known
  pre-existing failures, integration suite `1000+`, ROM 2.4b parity badge
  scoped to "gameplay 100%" (truer given the long tail of P2/P3 files), and
  active focus called out as `act_obj.c` (~60%).
- `AGENTS.md` Repo Hygiene §2 now requires that any change to README's
  Project Status / badges / metrics be accompanied in the same commit by a
  refresh of AGENTS.md tracker pointers and `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md`,
  preventing drift between the three surfaces. Underlying numbers stay
  sourced from `docs/parity/*` trackers.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **act_enter portal regressions** uncovered by the act_enter.c audit
  (PR #123):
  - `_stand_charmed_follower` now forwards `do_stand`'s returned string
    into the follower's message stream, so charmed sleepers receive the
    "You wake and stand up." text exactly as ROM `act_move.c:1044`
    sends inside `do_stand`.
  - `_portal_fade_out` now explicitly removes the portal from
    `room.contents` and clears `portal.location`. `game_loop._extract_obj`
    keys off `obj.in_room` but `Object` uses `obj.location`, so portal
    detachment after charge expiry was a silent no-op. Behavior now
    matches ROM `extract_obj(portal)` at `act_enter.c:212`.
  - `test_enter_closed_portal_denied`: corrected expected message to
    `"You can't seem to find a way in."` per ROM `act_enter.c:94`. The
    prior `"The portal is closed."` was the door-blocked message from
    `act_move.c`, not the portal path.
  - `test_move_through_portal_blocked_while_fighting`: corrected to
    assert silent return per ROM `act_enter.c:70-71`
    (`if (ch->fighting != NULL) return;`); removed the non-ROM
    `"No way!  You are still fighting!"` string.
- **`test_giant_strength_refuses_to_stack`** (was
  `test_stat_modifiers_stack_from_same_spell`): test asserted +4 STR after
  recasting giant strength, but ROM `src/magic.c:3022-3030`
  `spell_giant_strength` early-returns with "You are already as strong as
  you can get!" when the target is already affected. The Python
  implementation correctly mirrors ROM; the test was wrong. Rewrote the
  test to assert ROM anti-stack behavior.
- **`test_scavenger_prefers_valuable_items`**: flaky because the
  Mitchell-Moore RNG state leaks across tests, and the scavenger only acts
  on a 1/64 roll per `mobile_update` tick. Seed `rng_mm.seed_mm` to a
  known value at start of test and bump the iteration cap from 2000 to
  5000 for deterministic passes.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **act_enter.c parity (100% ROM parity for portal/enter mechanics):**
  Close all 15 ENTER-001..016 gaps documented in
  `docs/parity/ACT_ENTER_C_AUDIT.md`. 25 new integration tests in
  `tests/integration/test_act_enter_gaps.py`.

### Fixed

- **ENTER-009 (CRITICAL):** `do_enter` TO_CHAR message ("You enter $p." /
  "...somewhere else...") was being returned as a Python string and
  silently dropped — now delivered to the player.
- **ENTER-005:** Portal lookup uses `get_obj_list` (visibility,
  numbered syntax `2.portal`, keyword-list semantics) instead of fuzzy
  substring matching.
- **ENTER-004:** Non-portal objects and closed portals both produce
  `"You can't seem to find a way in."` (was diverging).
- **ENTER-008/010:** Departure/arrival TO_ROOM messages go through
  `act_format` + `broadcast_room` for correct `$n` invisibility
  resolution.
- **ENTER-011:** Portal fade-out only broadcasts in the old room when
  caller is in the old room; calls `extract_obj` on charge expiry.
- **ENTER-013:** `_get_random_room` capped at 100k iterations
  (was potentially returning None; ROM loops indefinitely).
- **ENTER-006/007/012:** Follower cascade — charmed followers stand
  before following, follower-name interpolation via `act_format`.
- **ENTER-002/003/014/015/016:** Cosmetic message wording matched to
  ROM and fighting-character silent-skip path.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **act_obj.c parity batch (100% ROM parity for object-manipulation
  commands):** do_get/do_put/do_drop/do_give/do_wear/do_remove/do_sacrifice/
  do_quaff/do_eat/do_drink/do_fill/do_pour/do_envenom/do_recite/do_brandish/
  do_zap/do_steal and shop commands (do_buy/do_sell/do_list/do_value).
  Adds full ROM TO_ROOM/TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT broadcasts via act_format +
  broadcast_room. ~80 new integration tests under tests/integration/.
- **act_move.c parity batch:** do_stand/do_rest/do_sit/do_sleep/do_wake
  rewritten with full ROM furniture support (STAND/SIT/REST/SLEEP_AT/ON/IN
  with capacity checks and ch.on tracking). MOVE-001 arrival broadcast,
  MOVE-002 follower-name interpolation, SNEAK-001/HIDE-001 dispatcher
  delegation to canonical handlers. 40 new integration tests in
  tests/integration/test_position_commands.py.
- **act_comm.c P2 batch:** do_emote NOEMOTE check, do_pmote (~312 lines),
  do_colour, do_split gold+silver simultaneous-split fix, do_pose pose_table
  by class+level. New mud/utils/poses.py.
- **act_info.c P2 batch:** do_title/do_description/auto-settings family
  (autolist, autoassist, autoexit, autogold, autoloot, autopeek, autosac,
  autosplit, autotitle).
- LIQUID_TABLE in mud/models/constants.py extended with proof/full/thirst/
  food/ssize fields sourced from ROM src/const.c:886-931.
- WebSocket stream support (mud/network/websocket_stream.py) for the
  browser frontend; tests in tests/test_websocket_server.py.

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md rewritten:** ~700 lines → 275. Removed running session
  narrative, duplicated status reporting, stale "next steps". Added Session
  Notes (docs/sessions/) and Repo Hygiene (CHANGELOG / README / semver in
  pyproject.toml) sections modeled on quickmud-web-client/AGENTS.md.
- 79 SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md and HANDOFF_*.md files moved from repo root to
  `docs/sessions/`.

### Fixed

- `_obj_from_char()` now operates on `char.inventory` (was reading the
  wrong field, so transferred objects were not removed from giver).
- `count_users()` in mud/handler.py now reads `room.people` (room.characters
  does not exist).
- String-keyed equipment lookups replaced with `WearLocation` IntEnum keys
  across BRANDISH/ZAP/POUR families.
- Hardcoded hex flag values replaced with enum members
  (`PlayerFlag.AUTOSPLIT`, `WearFlag.NO_SAC`, `ItemType.STAFF/WAND`, etc).
- `do_steal` MAX_LEVEL set to 60 (was 51); STEAL-001..014 covering
  one_argument semantics, is_safe, is_clan, sleeping-victim wake, PC→PC
  PlayerFlag.THIEF, multi_hit signature, NODROP/INVENTORY checks,
  can_see_object visibility filter.
- `do_recite/do_brandish/do_zap` success paths were unrunnable due to
  undefined SkillTarget, bad ItemType references, string-keyed HOLD
  lookup; all 17 RECITE/BRANDISH/ZAP gaps closed.

# `skills.c` — `do_gain` / `do_groups` Focused Audit (trainer & group commands)

- **Date opened:** 2026-06-19 (divergence-sweep probe)
- **ROM source:** `src/skills.c` — `do_gain` (44–250), `do_groups` (~850–920),
  `exp_per_level` (639+), `gn_add`/`group_add`
- **Python module(s):** `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py` (`do_gain`, `do_groups`)
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL — `do_gain` is substantially un-ported (the core
  "gain a skill/group" path is missing; `gain points` is backwards). Surfaced by
  a probe; the `skills.c` tracker row is ✅ 100% but covers the 37 skill
  **handlers**, not these trainer **commands**.

> **Why this exists:** `ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` marks `skills.c` "✅
> Audited 100% — All 37 skills have ROM parity tests." That audit verified the
> spell/skill **effect handlers**. The trainer command `do_gain` and the listing
> command `do_groups` were never audited against ROM and diverge materially.
> This is the third "100%-audited" file in the 2026-06-19 session found to hide
> gaps (after `healer.c` HEALER-005/006 and `board.c` Phase-1 doc-rot). The
> pattern: a file marked 100% on one slice of its surface is not 100% on all of it.

## Gap Table

| ID | Severity | ROM ref | Python ref | Description | Status |
|----|----------|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| GAIN-001 | CRITICAL | `src/skills.c:174-249` | `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:253` | `gain <group>` / `gain <skill>` is **not implemented**. ROM looks up the group (`group_lookup`) / skill (`skill_lookup`), validates already-known / class-rating / sufficient `train`, then learns it (`gn_add` for groups — **recursive**; `learned[sn]=1` for skills) and deducts `train -= rating[class]`. Python's final branch returns `"That is not a valid option. Try 'gain list'."` for **any** name — a player cannot gain skills/groups at a trainer. **Feature work, not a one-line fix** — depends on a recursive `gn_add` equivalent (Python has `account_service.add_group` but its recursion + `learned` skill structure must be verified) and the per-`gn` `group_known` representation (Python stores a tuple of names, not ROM's boolean array). **Scope before closing.** | ✅ FIXED — runtime `_gn_add` (recursive) + group/skill branches wired into `do_gain` (deduct `train`, not creation points); spell-gate via `Skill.type == "spell"`; final fall-through corrected to ROM "I do not understand..."; `tests/integration/test_do_gain_act_gain_bit.py` (gain group + component skills, gain skill, gain-spell refused, insufficient-train, already-known) |
| GAIN-002 | IMPORTANT | `src/skills.c:149-172` | `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:240-251` | `gain points` is **backwards on three counts**. ROM: gate `train < 2` → "not ready"; gate `points <= 40` → "There would be no point in that."; then `train -= 2`, **`points -= 1`**, `exp = exp_per_level(ch, points) * level`; message "$N trains you, and you feel more at ease with your skills." Python: same `train < 2` gate, **missing the `points <= 40` gate**, `train -= 2`, **`points += 1`** (wrong direction — `exp_per_level` rises with points, so ROM trades 2 trains to *lower* the point cost / make leveling easier; Python makes it harder), **no exp recalc**, and the wrong message ("you gain a creation point."). | ✅ FIXED — added `points <= 40` guard, flipped `+= 1`→`-= 1`, recompute `char.exp = exp_per_level(char) * level`, message "...feel more at ease with your skills."; `tests/integration/test_do_gain_act_gain_bit.py::test_gain_points_spends_two_trains_to_lower_points_and_recalcs_exp` + `::test_gain_points_refuses_when_points_at_or_below_40` |
| GAIN-003 | IMPORTANT | `src/skills.c:74-131` | `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:220-227` | `gain list` is a stub — returns "(Group listing not fully implemented)" / "(Skill listing not fully implemented)". ROM lists, in 3-column format, every group/skill the player does **not** know whose `rating[class] > 0` (skills additionally gated to non-spells, `spell_fun == spell_null`). Feature work, same infra gate as GAIN-001. | ✅ FIXED — `_gain_list` builds the two 3-column tables (unknown groups, unknown non-spell skills with `rating[class] > 0`); `tests/integration/test_do_gain_act_gain_bit.py::test_gain_list_shows_gainable_groups_and_nonspell_skills` + `::test_gain_list_excludes_known_groups` |
| GAIN-004 | MINOR | `src/skills.c:70,137-143,181-244` | `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:215-251` | Trainer lines use lowercase f-strings (`f"{trainer_name} tells you '...'"`) instead of ROM's `act("$N tells you '...'", …, TO_CHAR)` which first-letter-capitalizes (INV-029, the HEALER-005 act-cap class). Also the no-arg case: ROM is `do_function(trainer, &do_say, "Pardon me?")` — the trainer **says it to the room** via `do_say`, not a TO_CHAR return. Characterize as the act-cap class + a say-to-room nuance; do not let it become a rewrite. | ❌ OPEN |
| GROUPS-001 | CRITICAL | `src/skills.c` `do_groups` | `mud/commands/remaining_rom.py:276-295` | `do_groups` (no-arg) **crashes** for any player who knows groups: `group_known` is a `tuple[str, ...]` (`mud/models/character.py:213`) but the no-arg branch calls `sorted(group_known.keys())` and `group_known[name]` as if it were a dict → `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'keys'`. Empirically reproduced 2026-06-19. The `all` / `<group>` branches use the real `mud.skills.groups` table and are fine; only the no-arg "your known groups" branch has the stale dict assumption. | ✅ FIXED — no-arg branch now iterates the `group_known` name tuple directly; `tests/integration/test_do_groups_known_groups.py` |

## Notes

- GAIN-002 and GROUPS-001 are clean, self-contained units closed this session.

### GAIN-001 / GAIN-003 scope (infra verified 2026-06-19 — gate PASSED)

Every primitive exists; nothing new needs inventing. The only thing to **build**
is a runtime `gn_add` on a live `Character` (the existing recursion is
creation-session-bound).

**Infra inventory:**

| ROM primitive | Python equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `group_lookup` + `group_table[gn].rating[class]` + `.spells[]` | `mud.skills.groups.get_group(name)` → `GroupType.ratings`, `.skills` | ✅ |
| `skill_lookup` + `skill_table[sn].rating[class]` | `skill_registry.get(name)` → `Skill.ratings` / `Skill.rating[class_index]` | ✅ |
| `spell_fun != spell_null` ("must learn the full group" gate + list filter) | `Skill.type == "spell"` (`mud/skills/registry.py:266`) | ✅ |
| runtime `learned[sn]` / `group_known[gn]` | `pcdata.learned: dict[str,int]`, `pcdata.group_known: tuple[str,...]` | ✅ |
| recursive `gn_add` / `group_add` | `account_service.AccountService.add_group` (recurses child groups + grants component skills) | ⚠️ **logic correct but bound to the creation session** (`self._known_groups` / `self.creation_points`), not a live `Character.pcdata`. Cannot be called directly from `do_gain`. |

**Currency difference (critical):** character creation deducts **creation
points** (`points += rating`, `deduct=True`); the trainer (`do_gain`) deducts
**`train`** (`ch->train -= rating[class]`) and calls `gn_add(ch, gn)` with the
component-skill adds at `deduct=FALSE`. So the runtime path must NOT touch
`creation_points`.

**Implementation plan (decomposed, do not batch):**

1. **GAIN-001** (one commit) — add a runtime `_gn_add(char, group)` helper
   (rebuild the `group_known` name tuple + set `learned[skill]=1` for each
   component skill/sub-group, recursive, no currency deduction), then wire both
   `do_gain` branches:
   - **group branch** (ROM `skills.c:174-206`): `get_group` → already-known? →
     `rating[class] > 0`? → `train >= rating`? → `_gn_add` + `train -= rating` +
     `"$N trains you in the art of $t"`.
   - **skill branch** (ROM `skills.c:208-244`): `skill_registry.get` →
     `type == "spell"`? → "You must learn the full group." → already-known
     (`learned.get(name,0) > 0`)? → `rating > 0`? → `train >= rating`? →
     `learned[name]=1` + `train -= rating` + `"$N trains you in the art of $t"`.
   - One integration test: gain a group (verify group_known + component skills +
     train deducted), gain a skill, gain-spell-direct refused, insufficient-train
     refused, already-known refused. Add a save/reload round-trip assertion
     (learned/group_known already persist — confirm).
2. **GAIN-003** (one commit) — `gain list`: 3-column listing of groups
   (`rating[class] > 0`, not known) then skills (`rating[class] > 0`, not known,
   `type != "spell"`), mirroring ROM `skills.c:74-131`.
3. **GAIN-004** (one commit, optional) — capitalize trainer lines via the
   HEALER-005 `act`-cap pattern + the no-arg `do_say`-to-room nuance.

**Risks:** (a) the spell-vs-skill gate must use `Skill.type == "spell"` exactly,
or players could gain spells directly (a new divergence); (b) `group_known` is an
immutable tuple — rebuild on add; (c) confirm `learned`/`group_known` survive a
save/reload (they are existing pcdata fields, so expected to — assert it).

**Size:** medium (~1 helper + 2 branches + list + tests). No missing primitives —
**implementable faithfully now.**

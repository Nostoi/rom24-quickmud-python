# Session Summary — 2026-06-14 — do_bash `$M` render + is_safe convergence (FIGHT-075 / CONSIDER-002 / CAST-012 / FIGHT-076 / STEAL-003 / spec-funs)

## Scope

Picked up from the FIGHT-068/072/073 entry-gate session. The `fight.c`
offensive-skill entry-gate **ordering/message** sweep was exhausted except for
one spin-off (FIGHT-075). Closed it, then moved to the next-higher lever named
in the status doc — **INV-050** (converging the silent-bool `is_safe` callers
onto the faithful message-mirror `_kill_safety_message`) — and converged the
**second** (`do_consider`, CONSIDER-002), **third** (`do_cast`
`TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE`, CAST-012), **fourth** (`check_assist`, FIGHT-076), and
**fifth** (`do_steal`, STEAL-003) callers. One gap = one test = one commit
(do_bash was the first caller, converged last session under FIGHT-070). Also
ROM-corrected one standing pre-existing red test (do_kill charm gate) surfaced
by the assist fallout run, and filed STEAL-015 (the steal *skill-handler* has no
is_safe at all).

## Outcomes

### `FIGHT-075` — ✅ FIXED (2.14.108)

- **Python**: `mud/commands/combat.py:do_bash` (~combat.py:446)
- **ROM C**: `src/fight.c:2394`
- **Gap**: `do_bash`'s position-gate message was the literal "You'll have to let
  **them** get back up first." where ROM renders
  `act("You'll have to let $M get back up first.", ch, NULL, victim, TO_CHAR)`
  — `$M` = victim objective pronoun (him/her/it). Wrong pronoun render.
- **Fix**: `act_format("You'll have to let $M get back up first.",
  recipient=char, actor=char, arg2=victim)`. Same act()-render class as
  FIGHT-073/TRIP-001/FIGHT-064.
- **Tests**: 1 — `tests/integration/test_fight075_bash_position_pronoun_message.py`
  (male sitting victim → "him", not "them"). Verified red before, green after.

### `CONSIDER-002` — ✅ FIXED (2.14.109, INV-050 second caller)

- **Python**: `mud/commands/consider.py:do_consider` (~consider.py:43)
- **ROM C**: `src/act_info.c:2490-2493` + `src/fight.c:1018-1124`
- **Gap**: ROM `do_consider` runs `if (is_safe(ch,victim)) {
  send_to_char("Don't even think about it."); return; }`, and ROM `is_safe`
  writes its **own** rejection line via `send_to_char`/`act` *before* returning
  TRUE (e.g. "The shopkeeper wouldn't like that.", "I don't think Mota would
  approve."). So a blocked `consider` shows **two** lines. Python routed through
  the silent bool `combat.safety.is_safe` (writes no message) and printed only
  "Don't even think about it." — dropping ROM's context line.
- **Fix**: converged the gate onto the faithful mirror
  `combat._kill_safety_message` (the do_bash FIGHT-070 pattern). A non-None
  return == ROM `is_safe` returning TRUE; emit `f"{safety_message}\nDon't even
  think about it."`. Swapped the `from mud.combat.safety import is_safe` import
  for `from mud.commands.combat import _kill_safety_message` (no circular import
  — combat.py does not import consider.py).
- **Tests**: 1 — `tests/integration/test_consider002_safe_target_context_message.py`
  (healer victim → "...Mota would approve." + "Don't even think about it.").
  Verified red before, green after. All 18 do_consider tests pass (the pre-existing
  15 + CONSIDER-001's 2 + this one).

### `CAST-012` — ✅ FIXED (2.14.110, INV-050 third caller)

- **Python**: `mud/commands/combat.py:do_cast` (~combat.py:1016)
- **ROM C**: `src/magic.c:398-402` + `src/fight.c:1018-1124`
- **Gap**: ROM `do_cast`'s `TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE` gate runs
  `if (is_safe(ch,victim) && victim != ch) { send_to_char("Not on that
  target."); return; }`, and ROM `is_safe` writes its own rejection line before
  returning TRUE — two lines. CAST-007 wired the gate through the **silent bool**
  `combat.safety.is_safe`, surfacing only "Not on that target." and inheriting
  the bool's bidirectional over/under-block.
- **Fix**: converged the `TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE` ("victim") branch onto
  `_kill_safety_message` → `f"{safety_message}\nNot on that target."`. The
  `TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF` branch uses `is_safe_spell`, which is **silent in ROM**
  (`src/fight.c:1126-1218`) — correctly left as a bare override. Removed the
  now-unused `is_safe` import.
- **Block-set correction fallout (advisor-predicted)**: converging to the
  faithful mirror also corrects *which* casts block. Two CAST-007 tests asserted
  the silent-bool **under-block** — KILLER-flag set / charm stripped when casting
  at a **non-clan PC victim**, which ROM `is_safe` blocks at `!is_clan(victim)`
  *before* `check_killer` runs (`src/fight.c:1112`). Per AGENTS.md (a test
  contradicting ROM is the bug), both were ROM-corrected to a **clan victim
  within 8 levels** — the only PC-victim case ROM lets through to `check_killer`.
  A third test (`..._blocked_in_safe_room`) was passing for the wrong reason (PC
  victim blocked by the clan ladder, not ROOM_SAFE which ROM only checks for NPC
  victims); switched its victim to an NPC so it genuinely exercises ROOM_SAFE.
- **Tests**: 1 new (`TestCastOffensiveIsSafeContextMessage`) + 3 ROM-corrected.
  Full `test_do_cast_pk_gates.py` 18/18; verified red before, green after.

### `FIGHT-076` — ✅ FIXED (2.14.111, INV-050 fourth caller)

- **Python**: `mud/combat/assist.py:check_assist` (~assist.py:84)
- **ROM C**: `src/fight.c:131` + `src/fight.c:1018-1124`
- **Gap**: ROM `check_assist` gates the PC/charmed auto-assist on
  `is_same_group(ch,rch) && !is_safe(rch, victim)`. ROM `is_safe(rch, victim)`
  writes its own rejection line to **rch** (the autoassister) before returning
  TRUE. Python routed through the **silent bool**, which (a) wrote no message and
  (b) lacks the PC-vs-PC clan ladder — so a **non-clan PC group member wrongly
  auto-assisted in PvP**, silently.
- **Fix**: converged onto `_kill_safety_message(rch, victim)` — `None` → rch
  assists; a non-None string → rch is blocked and sees the line via the module's
  `_send_to_char`. Function-local import avoids an engine→command cycle. Removed
  the now-unused module-level `is_safe` import (two `test_fight060` tests
  monkeypatched it defensively though the NPC-assist branch never calls it —
  vestigial lines removed). Charmed-mob `rch` `send_to_char` no-ops (NPC, no
  descriptor), so only PC autoassisters observe the line.
- **Tests**: 1 new
  (`test_combat_assist.py::TestPlayerAutoAssist::test_autoassist_blocked_by_is_safe_clan_ladder`);
  red before, green after. Full assist/group slice 93 passed, 1 skipped.

### `STEAL-003` — ✅ FIXED (2.14.112, INV-050 fifth caller)

- **Python**: `mud/commands/thief_skills.py:do_steal` (~thief_skills.py:132)
- **ROM C**: `src/act_obj.c:2191-2192` + `src/fight.c:1018-1124`
- **Gap**: ROM `do_steal` calls `is_safe`, which sends its own context line before
  returning TRUE; do_steal then returns. STEAL-003's *original* fix returned `""`
  on the assumption "is_safe already messaged" — but it routed through the
  **silent bool**, which writes nothing, so a blocked steal showed nothing (and
  inherited the bool's missing PC clan ladder).
- **Fix**: converged onto `_kill_safety_message` (do_bash/consider/cast/assist
  pattern) — a non-None return is surfaced to ch.
- **Block-set fallout**: 4 tests ROM-corrected for the under-block —
  `test_steal_command.py::{test_steal_failure_pc_to_pc_sets_thief_flag,
  test_steal_level_diff_forces_failure_pc_to_pc}` and
  `test_inv025_steal_act_trigger_dispatch.py::{...notvict..., ...pc_victim_sees_message}`
  all reached PC-victim steal logic with a non-clan PC, which ROM is_safe blocks;
  corrected to clan thief/victim.
- **Tests**: 1 new
  (`test_steal_command.py::test_steal_from_safe_healer_surfaces_is_safe_line`);
  red before, green after. Full steal slice 40 passed.
- **Out-of-scope finding filed (STEAL-015 🔄 OPEN)**: the *skill-handler*
  `mud/skills/handlers.py:steal` (~7762) has **no is_safe at all** ("simplified -
  no is_safe implemented yet"), yet is registered as the "steal" skill function
  (`data/skills.json:1816`) — reachable via the skill system independently of the
  `do_steal` command. Filed in `ACT_OBJ_C_AUDIT.md`.

### `spec_troll_member` / `spec_ogre_member` — ✅ CONVERGED (2.14.113, INV-050 refactor)

- **Python**: `mud/spec_funs.py:spec_troll_member` (~1341), `spec_ogre_member` (~1382)
- **ROM C**: `src/special.c:145, 213` + `src/fight.c:1018-1124`
- **Nature**: a **refactor toward bool-retirement, not a player-facing fix.** Both
  faction spec-funs gated rival victim selection on the silent bool. Converged onto
  a `_is_safe_mirror` predicate over `_kill_safety_message`, correcting the bool's
  `ActFlag.GAIN` over-block (not in ROM is_safe). The message is **moot** here — the
  is_safe recipient is the NPC attacker, whose `send_to_char` no-ops (`desc==NULL`),
  exactly as ROM. Removed the now-unused `is_safe` import.
- **Tests**: 1 contract-assertion test
  (`test_spec_funs.py::test_spec_troll_member_attacks_gain_flagged_ogre` — a
  contrived GAIN-flagged ogre is now eligible; verified it changes *victim
  selection*, red before / green after). No live faction mob carries GAIN.
- **Significance**: with this, INV-050's **player-facing message-surfacing
  divergence is fully closed** (bash/consider/cast/assist/steal). The silent bool
  now serves only the intentionally-silent apply_damage re-check and
  `is_safe_spell`'s internal delegation.

### Pre-existing failure ROM-corrected (separate commit, NOT caused this session)

- **`test_combat.py::test_kill_blocks_charmed_player_attacking_master`** — a
  standing red test (failing since before this session's start commit
  `1b641732`, confirmed by bisect). It asserted the do_kill "beloved master"
  charm gate fires for a charmed PC attacking a **PC** master, but ROM do_kill
  (`src/fight.c:2793`) runs `is_safe` **before** the charm gate (`:2803`), and
  `is_safe` blocks a non-clan PC attacking any PC at "Join a clan if you want to
  kill players." The code was already ROM-correct (the faithful
  `_kill_safety_message` has had the PC clan ladder since FIGHT-074). Per AGENTS.md
  (a test contradicting ROM is the bug), ROM-corrected the test to an **NPC
  master** (mirroring the FIGHT-064 sibling), which passes is_safe so the charm
  gate is the observable result. Committed separately as `test(parity)`.

## Next Steps

- **INV-050 player-facing half is DONE.** All five message-surfacing callers
  (bash/consider/cast/assist/steal) now surface ROM's is_safe context line, and the
  two NPC-predicate spec-funs are converged. The silent bool now serves only the
  intentionally-silent apply_damage re-check (FIGHT-002 — leave as-is) and
  `is_safe_spell`'s internal delegation.
- **Bool retirement is GATED on an `is_safe_spell` audit** (do NOT skip this).
  `safety.py:is_safe_spell` delegates to `is_safe` (line 113), but ROM
  `is_safe_spell` (`src/fight.c:1126-1218`) is a **standalone** function with extra
  checks (area handling + the `victim->fighting != NULL && !is_same_group`
  legal-kill clause). So Python's `is_safe_spell` is *already* a latent divergence,
  and naively rewriting `is_safe` into a `_kill_safety_message` wrapper would
  silently shift `is_safe_spell` → do_cast's TAR_OBJ_CHAR_OFF branch. **Audit
  is_safe_spell vs ROM's standalone function first**, then retire/thin the bool.
- **STEAL-015 🔄 OPEN** — the steal *skill-handler* `skills/handlers.py:steal`
  (~7762) has no is_safe at all but is registered as the "steal" skill function;
  converge it onto `_kill_safety_message` too (returning the line in the result
  dict). Filed in `ACT_OBJ_C_AUDIT.md`.
- Beyond INV-050, per `docs/parity/DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER.md` the higher-yield
  open lever remains the **Hypothesis state-machine → diff_harness widening**
  (Class 11 / Phase C), enumeration-independent (guardrail 3).

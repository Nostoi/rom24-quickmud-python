## ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS RESULTS

MODE: Analysis Complete
INCOMPLETE_SUBSYSTEMS: 20 (confidence < 0.80)
TASKS_GENERATED: 2
NEXT_ACTION: Run AGENT.EXECUTOR.md

Critical Architectural Gaps:
- [P0] skills_spells (confidence 0.35): Faerie fire is still a stub that never applies the ROM `AFF_FAERIE_FIRE` affect, AC penalty, or pink-outline reveals, leaving no counterplay against the newly restored invisibility pipeline.
- [P0] skills_spells (confidence 0.35): Faerie fog remains unimplemented, so room-wide reveals never strip invisibility, sneak, or hide flags the way ROM’s spell loop does after checking saving throws.

RECOMMENDATION: Implement faerie fire’s glow debuff and the faerie fog reveal loop per `src/magic.c:2805-2844` so invisibility can be countered with ROM mechanics.

Updated PYTHON_PORT_PLAN.md: Yes

# QuickMUD Development Guide for AI Agents

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Command Parity - Better Than Expected! (Dec 2025)

**Previous Status (Outdated)**: 115/181 ROM commands (63.5%)  
**Current Status**: Integration tests show **93% pass rate** (40/43 tests)

**Update**: Most critical P0 commands are already implemented and working. Previous assessment was based on outdated documentation.

**See**: [Command Parity Status](#️-command-parity-status-updated-december-27-2025) section below for current details.

**Action Items**:
1. ~~Review COMMAND_PARITY_AUDIT.md~~ - Outdated, need new audit
2. ~~Implement P0 commands~~ - Already implemented!
3. Run `pytest tests/integration/` - **40/43 passing (93%)**
4. Create accurate command audit (in progress)

---

## 🤖 Autonomous Mode (ENABLED)

**When explicitly directed by user**, agent may enter autonomous task completion mode:

### Activation Criteria
- User explicitly says "start autonomous mode" or gives clear directive to "complete all tasks"
- User specifies scope (P0 only, P0+P1, or all tasks)
- User sets time limit and error handling policy

### Autonomous Workflow
1. ✅ Create comprehensive todo list from ARCHITECTURAL_TASKS.md
2. 🔄 Execute tasks sequentially without waiting for approval
3. 🔨 Fix errors immediately before proceeding to next task
4. ✅ Run full test suite after each major task
5. 📊 Run `scripts/test_data_gatherer.py` to verify ROM parity
6. 📝 Update ARCHITECTURAL_TASKS.md and PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md
7. 🎯 Stop at time limit or scope completion

### Quality Gates (MANDATORY)
- **After each task**: Run acceptance tests specified in ARCHITECTURAL_TASKS.md
- **After each task**: Run full test suite (200+ tests) to catch regressions
- **After all tasks**: Run `scripts/test_data_gatherer.py` for final parity verification
- **On any test failure**: Fix immediately before proceeding

### Stopping Conditions
- All tasks in scope complete
- Time limit reached
- Unrecoverable error (after 3 fix attempts)
- User interruption

**Current Session**: Autonomous mode ACTIVE
- **Scope**: P0 + P1 tasks (7 tasks)
- **Time Limit**: 2 hours
- **Error Policy**: Fix immediately
- **Started**: 2025-12-19 13:30 CST

## Specialized Agent Files

QuickMUD uses specialized agent files for different types of work:

### 1. **AGENT.md** - Architectural Analysis Agent
- **Purpose**: Identify and fix architectural integration gaps
- **Focus**: Subsystems with confidence < 0.92
- **Output**: P0/P1 architectural tasks with ROM C evidence
- **Use When**: Subsystems need structural improvements
- **Status**: Primary agent for architectural work

### 2. **FUNCTION_COMPLETION_AGENT.md** - Function Coverage Agent
- **Purpose**: Implement remaining 57 unmapped utility functions
- **Focus**: Helper functions, not architectural gaps
- **Output**: Function implementations with ROM parity
- **Use When**: Want to increase function coverage from 83.1% to 95%+
- **Scope**: ~12 hours work for 57 functions
- **Priority**: Optional (core ROM functionality already complete)

### 3. **AGENT.EXECUTOR.md** - Task Execution Agent
- **Purpose**: Execute tasks generated by AGENT.md
- **Focus**: Implementation of specific P0/P1 tasks
- **Output**: Code changes, tests, completion reports
- **Use When**: Tasks are defined and ready for implementation
- **Status**: Used for autonomous task completion

### Agent Selection Guide

| Goal | Use This Agent | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Fix subsystem integration issues | [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) | Start here for architectural work |
| Implement missing helper functions | [FUNCTION_COMPLETION_AGENT.md](FUNCTION_COMPLETION_AGENT.md) | Optional, 57 low-priority functions |
| Execute defined tasks autonomously | [AGENT.EXECUTOR.md](AGENT.EXECUTOR.md) | After tasks are generated |
| Verify behavioral parity | [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) Phase 3 | Runtime differential testing |

### When to Use FUNCTION_COMPLETION_AGENT.md

✅ **Use when:**
- Want to maximize function coverage (83.1% → 95%+)
- Need mobprog helpers for complex mob behaviors
- Want complete OLC helper utilities
- Time available for ~12 hours of implementation work

❌ **Skip when:**
- Core ROM gameplay is priority (already 83.1% complete)
- Prefer behavioral verification over function count
- Limited time (runtime testing has higher ROI)

The 57 remaining functions are utilities and helpers, not core ROM mechanics.

## Task Tracking (CRITICAL - READ FIRST!)

QuickMUD uses **THREE** task tracking systems. **ALWAYS update the appropriate file when completing work.**

### 1. TODO.md - High-Level Project Phases ✅ COMPLETE
- **Purpose**: 14 major project steps (data models → networking → deployment)
- **Status**: ALL STEPS COMPLETE - use for historical reference only
- **DO NOT UPDATE** - this tracks completed infrastructure work

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL_TASKS.md - ROM Parity Integration Tasks ✅ COMPLETE
- **Purpose**: Architecture-level integration gaps identified by AGENT.md analysis
- **Status**: ALL 7 P0/P1 tasks completed (2025-12-19)
- **When to Update**: Historical reference only - DO NOT UPDATE
- **Use Instead**: `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md` for remaining work
- **Completed Tasks**:
  - ✅ `[P0] Implement ROM LastObj/LastMob state tracking in reset_handler`
  - ✅ `[P0] Integrate encumbrance limits with inventory management`
  - ✅ `[P0] Complete help command dispatcher integration`
  - ✅ `[P0] Implement cross-area reference validation`
  - ✅ `[P1] Complete portal traversal with follower cascading`
  - ✅ `[P1] Implement trust-based help topic filtering`
  - ✅ `[P1] Complete format edge case error handling`

**✅ LEGACY FILE** - Use `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md` for active work

### 3. docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md - Complete ROM Parity Feature List 🎯 PRIMARY
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive tracking of ALL ROM 2.4b C features needed for 100% parity
- **Status**: Single source of truth for remaining parity work
- **When to Update**: When implementing any ROM parity features
- **Coverage**: 100% feature mapping (advanced mechanics, not just basic functionality)
- **Priority Levels**: P0-P3 matrix for implementation planning
- **Features**: Detailed breakdown of every missing ROM feature with C references

**🎯 PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH** - **USE THIS FILE** for:
- Identifying next parity work
- Checking implementation status
- Planning development roadmap
- Tracking progress toward 100% ROM parity

### 4. PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md - Subsystem Confidence Tracking
- **Purpose**: Tracks 27 subsystems by confidence score (0.00-1.00)
- **Updated By**: `scripts/test_data_gatherer.py` (automated) or manual analysis
- **When to Update**: After major subsystem work or test additions
- **Confidence Levels**:
  - ✅ Complete: ≥0.80 (production-ready)
  - ⚠️ Needs Work: <0.80 (incomplete)

**Check this file** to identify which subsystems need attention.

### Task Tracking Workflow

**When starting work:**
1. Check `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md` for specific parity features to implement
2. Check `PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md` for subsystem confidence levels
3. Use `CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` for overall project overview

**When completing work:**
1. ✅ Mark features complete in `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md`
2. Update subsystem confidence in `PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md` if applicable
3. Run `pytest` to verify no regressions
4. Update `CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` for major milestones

**Example completion format:**
```markdown
### 1. Reset System (confidence 0.38) - LastObj/LastMob State Tracking

**✅ [P0] Implement ROM LastObj/LastMob state tracking in reset_handler** - COMPLETED 2025-12-19

- **FILES**: `mud/spawning/reset_handler.py`, `mud/loaders/reset_loader.py`
- **COMPLETED BY**: [Your completion notes here]
- **TESTS ADDED**: `tests/test_reset_state_tracking.py` (15 tests)
- **ACCEPTANCE**: ✅ `pytest tests/test_area_loader.py::test_midgaard_reset_validation` passes
```

### Quick Reference: Which File to Update?

| Work Type | Update File |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ROM parity feature implementation** | `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md` 🎯 **PRIMARY** |
| Subsystem confidence changed significantly | `PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md` |
| Session summary or milestone | `CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` |
| Builder tools or OLC work | Individual completion reports (e.g., `BUILDER_TOOLS_COMPLETION.md`) |
| Architectural integration (HISTORICAL) | `ARCHITECTURAL_TASKS.md` ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| General todos (infrastructure) | `TODO.md` (rarely - mostly complete) |

## ⚠️ Command Parity Status (Updated December 27, 2025)

**Previous Assessment (Outdated)**: 63.5% command coverage (115/181 ROM commands)  
**Current Reality**: **Much better than previously stated!**

**What Changed**: Integration testing revealed that most P0 commands were already implemented. The previous assessment was based on outdated documentation.

### Current Status

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Backend Mechanics** | ✅ 83.1% function coverage | Combat, movement, skills work |
| **Data Model** | ✅ 97.5% complete | 273 player tests passing |
| **Unit Tests** | ✅ 1816 tests passing | Components work in isolation |
| **Integration Tests** | ✅ **40/43 passing (93%)** | **Most workflows work!** |

### Integration Test Results (December 27, 2025)

```bash
pytest tests/integration/ -v
# Result: 40 passed, 3 failed (93% pass rate)
```

**✅ All P0 Commands VERIFIED WORKING:**
- `look <target>` ✅ - Examines characters, objects, directions
- `tell <mob>` ✅ - Can tell to mobs
- `consider <mob>` ✅ - Assess difficulty
- `give <item> <target>` ✅ - Give items
- `follow <target>` ✅ - Follow mechanics
- `group <target>` ✅ - Group formation
- `flee` ✅ - Escape combat
- `say <message>` ✅ - Room communication

**❌ Only 3 Failing Tests** (Advanced Features):
- Mob program quest workflows (mobprog feature)
- Mob spell casting at low health (mobprog feature)
- Guard chain reactions (mobprog feature)

### Previous Assessment vs Reality

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| ❌ "look <target> broken" | ✅ Works perfectly |
| ❌ "tell <mob> broken" | ✅ Works perfectly |
| ❌ "follow doesn't exist" | ✅ Fully implemented |
| ❌ "group doesn't exist" | ✅ Fully implemented |
| ❌ "consider doesn't exist" | ✅ Fully implemented |
| ❌ "give doesn't exist" | ✅ Fully implemented |

### What's Actually Missing?

**Need accurate audit** - Previous command counts (115/181) may be incorrect.

**Action Items**:
1. ✅ Update AGENTS.md with correct status (DONE)
2. ⏳ Create accurate command audit by checking command registry
3. ⏳ Document which ROM commands are ACTUALLY missing
4. ⏳ Fix 3 failing mobprog tests (advanced feature, not critical)

### Reference Documents

**Current Integration Test Status**:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/ -v
# 40 passed, 3 failed (93%)
```

See `tests/integration/README.md` for test details.

### Integration Test Framework

**Current test suite**: `tests/integration/` - Tests complete player workflows

```bash
# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v
# Result: 40 passed, 3 failed (93% pass rate)

# See what's working
pytest tests/integration/test_player_npc_interaction.py -v
# Result: 13/13 passing (100%)
```

**Key insight**: Unit tests verify backend works. Integration tests verify commands work. **Most commands work!**

### Next Steps

**To find what's actually missing**:
```bash
# Compare command registry to ROM command table
python3 -c "from mud.commands.registry import command_registry; print(f'Registered commands: {len(command_registry)}')"

# Check ROM C command count
grep -c "do_" src/interp.c  # Count ROM commands
```

**Priority**:
1. Create accurate command audit (compare registry to ROM)
2. Fix 3 failing mobprog tests (advanced feature)
3. Implement any truly missing commands

### Success Criteria (Updated)

| Milestone | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Current** | 40/43 passing (93%) | ✅ Most gameplay works |
| **Target** | 43/43 passing (100%) | Fix 3 mobprog tests |

**Before claiming "100% command parity"**:
- [x] Core P0 commands work (look, tell, consider, give, follow, group, flee)
- [x] Integration tests pass for player/NPC interaction
- [x] New player can: visit shop, buy items, group up, fight mobs
- [ ] Accurate command audit completed
- [ ] Mobprog tests fixed (advanced feature)

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests (200+ tests, ~16s)
pytest

# Run integration tests (end-to-end workflows)
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run single test file
pytest tests/test_combat.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/test_combat.py::test_rescue_checks_group_permission

# Run tests matching keyword
pytest -k "movement"

# Run with coverage (CI requirement: ≥80%)
pytest --cov=mud --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80

# Test all commands (comprehensive command validation)
python3 test_all_commands.py

# Lint with ruff
ruff check .
ruff format --check .

# Type check with mypy (strict on specific modules)
mypy mud/net/ansi.py mud/security/hash_utils.py --follow-imports=skip
```

**Three Testing Levels**:
1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/test_*.py`) - Verify components work in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`) - Verify complete player workflows work
3. **Command Tests** (`test_all_commands.py`) - Verify all 287 commands can be called without import/module errors

**Always run all three** when implementing new commands!

### Command Validation Script

The `test_all_commands.py` script provides comprehensive command testing:

```bash
# Run comprehensive command test
python3 test_all_commands.py

# What it tests:
#  - All 287 registered commands
#  - Import resolution (no missing modules)
#  - Command execution (no crashes)
#  - Return type validation (all return strings)
#  - Categorized error reporting

# Expected results:
#  ✅ 277/287 commands working (96.5%)
#  ❌ 10 commands need game state (rooms, boards, etc.)
```

**Use this script to:**
- Verify no import errors after adding new commands
- Test commands work without starting the full MUD server
- Catch broken imports before committing
- Validate command parity is maintained

## Code Style Guidelines

**Imports:** `from __future__ import annotations` first; stdlib, third-party, local (alphabetical within groups)  
**Types:** Strict annotations throughout; use `TYPE_CHECKING` guard for circular imports  
**Naming:** `snake_case` functions/vars, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_CASE` constants, `_prefix` for private  
**Docstrings:** Required for public functions; include ROM C source references for parity code  
**Error handling:** Defensive programming with try/except; specific exceptions where possible  
**Formatting:** Line length 120 (ruff/black), double quotes, 4-space indent

## ROM Parity Rules (CRITICAL)
- **RNG:** Use `rng_mm.number_*` family, NEVER `random.*` in combat/affects  
- **Math:** Use `c_div`/`c_mod` for C integer semantics, NEVER `//` or `%`  
- **Enums:** ALWAYS use `PlayerFlag`/`CommFlag`/etc enums, NEVER hardcode flag values
  - **Wrong:** `PLR_AUTOLOOT = 0x00000800` (bit 11)
  - **Correct:** `PlayerFlag.AUTOLOOT` (1 << 4 = 0x0010, bit 4)
  - **Why:** ROM C enum values use bit shifts; hardcoded hex values will be wrong
  - **Note:** `PlayerFlag.COLOUR` is in `act` field, NOT `comm` field
- **Comments:** Reference ROM C sources (e.g., `# mirroring ROM src/fight.c:one_hit`)  
- **Tests:** Golden files derived from ROM behavior; assert exact C semantics  
- See `port.instructions.md` for exhaustive parity rules

## Test Fixtures (from conftest.py)
```python
movable_char_factory(name, room_vnum, points=100)  # Test character with movement
movable_mob_factory(vnum, room_vnum, points=100)   # Test mob with movement  
object_factory(proto_kwargs)                       # Object without placement
place_object_factory(room_vnum, vnum=..., proto_kwargs=...)  # Object in room
portal_factory(room_vnum, to_vnum, closed=False)   # Portal object
ensure_can_move(entity, points=100)                # Setup movement fields
```

## CI Workflow
Pre-commit hooks run `black`, `ruff --fix`, and fixture lint. CI runs: help data drift check, ruff/flake8 lint, mypy type check (select modules), pytest with 80% coverage, telnet tests (Linux only). All must pass.
